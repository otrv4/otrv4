# OTR version 4

```
Disclaimer

This protocol specification is a draft. It's currently under constant revision.
```

This document describes version 4 of the Off-the-Record Messaging protocol.
OTR version 4 (OTRv4) provides a deniable authenticated key exchange (DAKE) and
better forward secrecy through the use of double ratcheting. OTR works on top of
an existing messaging protocol, such as XMPP.

## Main Changes over Version 3

- Security level raised to 224 bits and based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  (ECC).
- Additional protection against transcript decryption in the case of ECC
  compromise.
- The cryptographic primitives and protocols have been updated:
  - Deniable authenticated key exchanges (DAKE) using "DAKE with Zero Knowledge"
    (DAKEZ) and "Extended Zero-knowledge Diffie-Hellman" (XZDH)
    [\[1\]](#references).
    DAKEZ corresponds to conversations when both parties are online
    (interactive) and XZDH to conversations when one of the parties is offline
    (non-interactive).
  - Key management using the Double Ratchet Algorithm [\[2\]](#references).
  - Upgraded SHA-1 and SHA-2 to SHAKE-256.
  - Switched from AES to XSalsa20 [\[3\]](#references).
- Support of an out-of-order network model.
- Support of different modes in which this specification can be implemented.
- Explicit instructions for producing forged transcripts using the same
  functions used to conduct honest conversations.

Reasons for the decisions made above and more are included in the [architectural
decisions records](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/architecture-decisions).

## High Level Overview

An OTRv4 conversation may begin when the two participants are online (an
interactive conversation) or when one participant is offline (non-interactive
conversation).

### Conversation started by an Interactive DAKE

```
Alice                                                Bob
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requests OTR conversation            ------------->

Establishes Conversation with DAKEZ  <------------>  Establishes Conversation with DAKEZ

Exchanges Data Messages              <------------>  Exchanges Data Messages
```

The conversation can begin after one participant requests a conversation. This
includes an advertisement of which versions the participant supports. If the
other participant supports OTRv4, an interactive DAKE can be used to establish a
secure channel. Encrypted messages are then exchanged in this secure channel
with strong forward secrecy.

### Conversation started by a Non-Interactive DAKE

```
Alice                      Untrusted Prekey Server         Bob
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    (<--------------------- Pre-conversation: Creates
                                                            and sends a Prekey Message)
Retrieves Bob's  ----------------->
Prekey Message

Establishes Conversation  ------------------------------->
with XZDH and sends the
first Data Message

Exchanges Data Messages <---------------------------------->  Exchanges Data Messages

```

The conversation can begin when one participant retrieves the other's
participant Prekey message from a prekey server. Prior to the start of the
conversation, this Prekey message would have had to be uploaded by the other
participant's client to a server. This have to be done so other participants,
like Alice, can send messages to the other participant, like Bob, while they are
offline.

## Assumptions

Messages in a conversation can be exchanged over an insecure channel, where an
attacker can eavesdrop or interfere with the messages.

The network model provides in-order and out-of-order delivery of messages. Some
messages may not be delivered.

OTRv4 does not protect against an active attacker performing Denial of Service
attacks.

## Security Properties

OTRv4 is the version 4 of the cryptographic protocol OTR. It provides end-to-end
encryption, which is a system by which information is sent over a network in
such a way that only the recipient and sender can read the it.

OTRv4 provides trust establishment (user verification) by fingerprint
verification or by the ability to perform the Socialist Millionaires Protocol
(SMP). This is a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol that determines if
secret values held by two parties are equal without revealing the value
itself.

In the interactive DAKE, although access to one participant's private long term
key is required for authentication, both participants can deny having used
their private long term keys. A forged transcript of the DAKE can be produced at
any time by anyone who knows the long-term public keys of both alleged
participants. This capability is called offline deniability because no
transcript provides evidence of a past key exchange, as this could have been
forged. It is provided for both participants in an interactive DAKE.

Furthermore, participants in the interactive DAKE, cannot provide proof of
participation to third parties without making themselves vulnerable to Key
Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attacks, even if they perform arbitrary protocols
with these third parties. A KCI attack begins when the long-term secret key of a
participant of a vulnerable DAKE is compromised. With this secret key, an
adversary can impersonate other users to the owner of the key. The property by
which participants  cannot provide proof of participation to third parties is
known as online or participation deniability.

Both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive) provide offline deniability as
anyone can forge a DAKE transcript between two parties using their long-term
public keys.

In the non-interactive DAKE, the initiator (Bob, in the above overview) has
participation deniability, but Alice, the responder, does not. This happens as
there can exist a protocol whereby a third party, with Alice's help, can
establish an authenticated conversation with Bob in Alice's name without having
to learn her private keys. This generates irrefutable cryptographic proof that a
conversation took place.

Although both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive) provide offline
deniability, take into account that there may be a loss of deniability if an
interactive DAKE is followed by a non-interactive one.

Once a conversation has been established with the DAKE, all data messages
transmitted in it are confidential and retain their integrity. They are
authenticated using a MAC. As MAC keys are published and OTRv4 uses malleable
encryption, anyone can forge data messages, and consequently, deny their
contents.

Furthermore, OTRv4 provides forward secrecy. An adversary that compromises the
long-term secret keys of both parties cannot retroactively compromise past
session keys. The interactive DAKE offers strong forward secrecy (it protects
the session key when at least one party completes the exchange). The
non-interactive DAKE offers a forward secrecy that is between strong and
weak, as it protects completed sessions and incomplete sessions that stall long
enough to be invalidated by a participant. The key exchange mechanism used
in OTRv4 is the Double Ratchet algorithm which provides forward and backward
secrecy, as parties negotiate secrets several times using an ephemeral key
exchange.

A protocol provides forward secrecy if the compromise of a long-term key does
not allow ciphertexts encrypted with previous session keys to be decrypted. If
the compromise of a long-term key does not allow subsequent ciphertexts to be
decrypted by passive attackers, then the protocol is said to have backward
secrecy. Furthermore, if the compromise of a single session key is not
permanent, as, after some time, subsequent messages will be impossible to
decrypt again because of the "self-healing" nature of the algorithm, then the
protocol is said to have post-compromise security. OTRv4, by using the Double
Ratchet Algorithm, provides these three properties. If key material used to
encrypt a particular data message is compromised, previous messages are
protected. Additionally, future messages are protected by the Diffie-Hellman and
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman ratchets.

The DAKEs in OTRv4 provide contributiveness as well. This means that the
initiator of the protocol cannot force the shared secret to take on a specific
value. It is also computationally infeasible for the responder to select a
specific shared secret. Bothe DAKEs are provable secure.

OTRv4 does not take advantage of quantum resistant algorithms. There are several
reasons for this. Mainly, OTRv4 aims to be a protocol that is easy to implement
in today's environments and within a year. Current quantum resistant algorithms
and their respective implementations are not ready enough to allow for this
implementation time frame. As a result, the properties mentioned in these
paragraphs only apply to non-quantum adversaries.

The only exception is the usage of a "brace key" to provide some
post-conversation transcript protection against potential weaknesses of elliptic
curves and the early arrival of quantum computers.

These security properties only hold for when a conversation with OTRv4 is
started. They do not hold for the previous versions of the OTR protocol, meaning
that if a user that supports version 3 and 4 starts a conversation with someone
that only supports version 3, a conversation with OTRv3 will start, and its
security properties will not be the ones stated in these paragraphs.

## OTRv4 Modes

In order for OTRv4 to be an alternative to current messaging applications, to
be compatible with the OTRv3 specification and to be useful for instant
messaging protocols (e.g. XMPP), the OTRv4 protocol must define different modes
in which it can be implemented: a OTRv3-compatible mode, a OTRv4 standalone
mode, and a OTRv4 interactive-only-mode. These are the three modes enforced by
this protocol specification, but, it must be taken into account, that OTRv4 can
and may be also implemented in other modes.

The modes are:

1. OTRv3-compatible mode: a mode with backwards compatibility with OTRv3. This
   mode will know how to handle plaintext messages, including query messages and
   whitespace tags.
2. OTRv4-standalone mode: an always encrypted mode. This mode will not know how
   to handle any kind of plaintext messages, including query messages and
   whitespace tags. It supports both interactive and non-interactive
   conversations. It is not backwards compatible with OTRv3.
3. OTRv4-interactive-only: an always encrypted mode that provides higher
   deniability properties when compared to the previous two modes, as it
   achieves offline and online deniability for both participants in a
   conversation. It only supports interactive conversations. It is not backwards
   compatible with OTRv3.

For details on how these modes work, review the
[modes](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/modes) folder.

Take into account, that some clients might implement different modes when
talking with each other. In those cases:

* If a client implements "OTRv4-standalone" mode or "OTRv4-interactive-only"
  mode and a request for an OTRv3 conversation arrives, reject this request.
* If a client implements "OTRv4-interactive-only" mode and a request for an
  offline conversation arrives, reject this request.

Take into account, as well, that OTRv4' state machine will need to know the mode
is working on when initialized. It will also need to take this mode into account
every time it makes a decision on how to transition from every state.

## Notation and Parameters

This section contains information needed to understand the parameters, variables
and arithmetic used in the specification.

### Notation

Scalars and secret keys are in lower case, such as `x` or `y`. Points and public
keys are in upper case, such as `P` or `Q`.

Addition of elliptic curve points `A` and `B` is `A + B`. Subtraction is
`A - B`. Addition of a point to another point generates a third point. Scalar
multiplication of an elliptic curve point `B` with a scalar `a` yields a new
point: `C = B * a`. For details on how to implement these operations, see the
[Elliptic Curve Operations](#elliptic-curve-operations) section.

The concatenation of byte sequences `I` and `J` is `I || J`. In this case, `I`
and `J` represent a fixed-length byte sequence encoding of the respective
values. See the section on [Data Types](#data-types) for encoding and decoding
details.

A scalar modulo `q` is a field element, and should be encoded and decoded
as a `SCALAR` type, which is defined in the [Data Types](#data-types) section.

A point should be encoded and decoded as a `POINT` type, which is defined in the
[Data Types](#data-types) section.

The byte representation of a value `x` is defined as `byte(x)`.

The endianness is little and big-endian. Data types that are specific to
elliptic curve arithmetic (`POINT`, `SCALAR`, `ED448-PUBKEY`,
`ED448-SHARED-PREKEY` and `EDDSA-SIG`) are encoded as little-endian. The rest of
data types are encoded as big-endian. Little-endian encoding into bits places
bits from left to right and from least significant to most significant.
Big-endian encoding into bits places bits from right to left and from most
significant to least significant.

### Elliptic Curve Parameters

OTRv4 uses the Ed448-Goldilocks [\[4\]](#references) elliptic curve
[\[5\]](#references). Ed448-Goldilocks is an untwisted Edwards curve, where:

```

#### Verifying that a point is on the curve

To verify that a point (`X = x, y`) is on curve Ed448-Goldilocks:

1. Check that `X` is not equal to the identity element (`I`).
2. Check that `X` lies on the curve: `x` and `y` are on in interval
   `[0, q - 1]`.
3. Check that `q * X = I`.

```

Whenever you see an operation on a field element from this group, the operation
should be done modulo the prime `dh_p`.

#### Verifying that an integer is in the DH group

To verify that an integer (`x`) is on the group with a 3072-bit modulus:

1. Check that `x` is `>= g3` and `<= dh_p - g3`.
2. Compute `x ^ q mod p`. If `result == 1`, the integer is a valid element.
   Otherwise the integer is an invalid element.

### Key Derivation Functions

The following key derivation functions are used:

```
KDF_1(usageID || values, output_size) = SHAKE-256("OTRv4" || usageID || values, size)
```

The `size` first bytes of the SHAKE-256 output for input
`"OTRv4" || usageID || m` are returned.

```
KDF_2(values, size) = SHAKE-256(values, size)
```

The `size` first bytes of the SHAKE-256 output for input `values` are returned.
This `KDF_2` is used when referring to RFC 8032.

## Data Types

OTRv4 uses many of the data types already specified in OTRv3 specification:

```
Bytes (BYTE):
  1 byte unsigned value
Shorts (SHORT):
  2 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Ints (INT):
  4 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Multi-precision integers (MPI):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte unsigned value, big-endian
  (MPIs must use the minimum-length encoding; i.e. no leading 0x00 bytes.
   This is important when calculating public key fingerprints)
Opaque variable-length data (DATA):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte data
```

OTRv4 also uses the following data types:

```
Nonce (NONCE):
  24 bytes data

Message Authentication Code (MAC):
  64 bytes MAC data

Ed448 point (POINT):
  57 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

Ed448 scalar (SCALAR):
  56 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

User Profile (USER-PROF):
  Detailed in "User Profile Data Type" section

Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF)
  Detailed in "Prekey Profile Data Type" section
```

In order to encode a point or a scalar into `POINT` or `SCALAR` data types, and
to decode a `POINT` or `SCALAR` data types into a point or a scalar, refer to
the [Encoding and Decoding](#encoding-and-decoding) section.

### Encoding and Decoding

This section describes the encoding and decoding schemes specified in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references) for scalars and points. Note that, although the RFC 8032
defines parameters as octet strings, they are defined as bytes here. It also
describes the encoding of the OTRv4 messages that should be transmitted encoded.

#### Scalar

Encoded as a little-endian array of 56 bytes, e.g.
`h[0] + 2^8 * h[1] + ... + 2^447 * h[55]`.
Take into account that the scalars used for public key generation are 57 bytes
long and encoded as: `h[0] + 2^8 * h[1] + ... + 2^448 * h[56]`. This latter
scalar is not sent over the wire.

#### Point

A curve point `(x,y)`, with coordinates in the range `0 <= x,y < p`, is
encoded as follows:

1. Encode the y-coordinate as a little-endian array of 57 bytes. The final byte
   is always zero.
2. Copy the least significant bit of the x-coordinate to the most significant
   bit of the final byte. This is `1` if the x-coordinate is negative or `0`
   if it is not.

A curve point is decoded as follows:

1. Interpret the 57-byte array as an integer in little-endian representation.
2. Interpret bit 455 as the least significant bit of the x-coordinate. Denote
   this value `x_0`.  The y-coordinate is recovered simply by clearing this bit.
   If the resulting value is `>= p`, decoding fails.
3. To recover the x-coordinate, the curve equation implies
   `x^2 = (y^2 - 1) / (d * y^2 - 1) (mod p)`. The denominator is always non-zero
   mod `p`.
   1. Let `num = y^2 - 1` and `denom = d * y^2 - 1`. To compute the square root
      of `(num/denom)`, compute the candidate root `x = (num/denom)^((p+1)/4)`.
      This can be done using a single modular powering for both the
      inversion of `denom` and the square root:

      ```
           x = ((num ^ 3) * denom * (num^5 * denom^3) ^ ((p-3)/4)) (mod p)
      ```

   2.  If `denom * x^2 = num`, the recovered x-coordinate is `x`. Otherwise, no
       square root exists, and decoding fails.
4. Use the `x_0` bit to select the right square root:
   * If `x = 0`, and `x_0 = 1`:
     * Decoding fails.
   * Otherwise, if `x_0 != x mod 2`:
     * Set `x <-- p - x`.
     * Return the decoded point `(x,y)`.

#### Encoded Messages

OTRv4 messages must be base-64 encoded. To transmit one of these messages,
construct an ASCII string: the five bytes "?OTR:", the base-64 encoding of the
binary form of the message and the byte ".".

### Serializing the Ring Signature Proof of Authentication

The Ring Signature's non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of authentication is
serialized as follows:

```
Ring Signature Authentication (RING-SIG):
  c1 (SCALAR)
  r1 (SCALAR)
  c2 (SCALAR)
  r2 (SCALAR)
  c3 (SCALAR)
  r3 (SCALAR)
```

### Public keys, Shared Prekeys and Fingerprints

OTR users have long-lived public keys that they use for authentication (but not 
for encryption). OTRv4 introduces a new type of public key:

```
OTRv4's public authentication Ed448 key (ED448-PUBKEY):

  Pubkey type
    2 byte unsigned value, little-endian
    Ed448 public keys have type 0x0010

  H (POINT)
    H is the Ed448 public key generated as defined in RFC 8032.
```

OTRv4's public shared prekey is defined as follows:

```
OTRv4's public shared prekey (ED448-SHARED-PREKEY):

  Shared Prekey type
    2 byte unsigned value, little-endian
    Ed448 shared prekey have type 0x0011

  D (POINT)
    D is the Ed448 shared prekey generated the same way as the public key in
    RFC 8032.
```

The public key and shared prekey are generated as follows (refer to RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), for more information on key generation). Note that,
although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are defined as
bytes here:

```
The symmetric key (sym_key) is 57 bytes of cryptographically secure random data.

1. Hash the 'sym_key' using KDF_2(sym_key, 114). Store the digest in a 114-byte
   buffer. Only the lower 57 bytes (denoted 'h') are used for generating the
   public key.
2. Prune the buffer 'h': the two least significant bits of the first
   byte are cleared, all eight bits of the last byte are cleared, and the
   highest bit of the second to last byte is set.
3. Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming the
   secret scalar 'sk'.  Perform a known-base-point scalar multiplication
   'sk * Base point (G)'. If the result is for the 'ED448-PUBKEY', store it in
   'H', encoded as POINT.  If the result is for the 'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY', store
   it in 'D', encoded as POINT.
4. Securely store 'sk' locally, as 'sk_h' for 'ED448-PUBKEY' and 'sk_d' for
   'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY'. These keys will be stored for as long as the
   'ED448-PUBKEY' and the 'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY' respectevely live. Addionally,
   securely store 'sym_key'. This key will be used for the User and Prekey
   profiles signature. After their public key counterpart expires, they should
   be securely deleted or replaced.
5. Securely delete 'h'.
```

Public keys have fingerprints, which are hex strings that serve as identifiers
for the public key. The full OTRv4 fingerprint is calculated by taking the
SHAKE-256 hash of the byte-level representation of the public key. To
authenticate a long-term key pair, the [Socialist Millionaire's
Protocol](#socialist-millionaires-protocol-smp) or a manual fingerprint
comparison may be used. The fingerprint is generated as:

* The first 56 bytes from the `KDF_1(0x00 || byte(H), 56)` (224-bit security
  level).

### Instance Tags

Clients include instance tags in all OTRv4 messages. Instance tags are 4-byte
values that are intended to be persistent. If the same client is logged into the
same account from multiple locations, the intention is that the client will have
different instance tags at each location. OTRv4 messages (fragmented and
unfragmented) include the source and destination instance tags. If a client
receives a message that lists a destination instance tag different from its own,
the client should discard the message.

The smallest valid instance tag is `0x00000100`. It is appropriate to set the
destination instance tag to `0` when an actual destination instance tag is not
known at the time the message is prepared. If a client receives a message with
the sender instance tag set to less than `0x00000100`, it should discard the
message. Similarly, if a client receives a message with the recipient instance
tag set to greater than `0` but less than `0x00000100`, it should discard the
message.

This practice avoids an issue on IM networks that always relay all messages to
all sessions of a client who is logged in multiple times. In this situation, OTR
clients can attempt to establish an OTR session indefinitely if there are
interleaving messages from each of the sessions.

### TLV Record Types

Each TLV record is of the form:

```
Type (SHORT)
  The type of this record. Records with unrecognized types should be ignored
Length (SHORT)
  The length of the following field
Value (len BYTE) [where len is the value of the Length field]
  Any pertinent data for the record type
```

OTRv4 supports some TLV record types from OTRv3. The supported types are:

```
Type 0: Padding
  The value may be an arbitrary amount of data. This data should be ignored.
  This type can be used to disguise the length of a plaintext message.
  XSalsa20, the algorithm used for encryption of the messages, is a stream
  cipher and, therefore, no padding is required. If you want to do message
  padding (to disguise the length of your message), use this TLV.

Type 1: Disconnected
  If the participant requests to close the private connection, you may send a
  message (possibly with empty human-readable part) containing a record with
  this TLV type just before you discard the session keys, and transition to
  'START' state (see below). If you receive a TLV record of this type, you
  should transition to 'FINISHED' state (see below), and inform the participant
  that its correspondent has closed its end of the private connection, and the
  participant should do the same. Old mac keys can be attached to this TLV when
  the session is expired. This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 2: SMP Message 1
  The value represents the initial message of the Socialist Millionaires'
  Protocol (SMP). Note that this represents TLV type 1 and 7 from OTRv3.
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 3: SMP Message 2
  The value represents the second message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 4: SMP Message 3
  The value represents the third message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 5: SMP Message 4
  The value represents the final message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 6: SMP Abort Message
  If the participant cancels the SMP prematurely or encounters an error in the
  protocol and cannot continue, you may send a message (possibly with an empty
  human-readable part) with this TLV type to instruct the other party's client
  to abort the protocol. The associated length should be zero and the
  associated value should be empty. If you receive a TLV of this type, you
  should change the SMP state to 'SMPSTATE_EXPECT1' (see below, in SMP section).
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 7: Extra symmetric key
  If you wish to use the extra symmetric key, compute it yourself as outlined
  in the section "Extra symmetric key". Then send this type 7 TLV to your peer
  to indicate that you'd like to use the extra symmetric key for something. The
  value of the TLV begins with a 4-byte indication of what this symmetric key
  will be used for (file transfer, voice encryption, etc). After that, the
  contents are use-specific (which file, etc): there are no predefined uses.
  Note that the value of the key itself is not placed into the TLV, your peer
  will compute it on its own. This TLV represents TLV type 8 from OTRv3.
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.
```

### Shared Session State

Both the interactive and non-interactive DAKEs must authenticate their contexts
to prevent attacks that rebind the DAKE transcript into different contexts. If
the higher-level protocol ascribes some property to the connection, the DAKE
exchange should verify this property, so both sides of a conversation can
cryptographically verify some beliefs they have about the session.

A session is created when a new OTRv4 conversation begins. Given a shared
session state information `phi` (e.g., a session identifier) associated with the
higher-level context (e.g., XMPP), the DAKE authenticates that both parties
share the same value for `phi` (Φ).

The shared session state (Φ) verifies shared state from the higher-level
protocol as well as from OTR itself. Therefore, an implementer (who has complete
knowledge of the application network stack) should define a known shared session
state from the higher-level protocol as `phi`, as well as include the values
imposed by this specification.

```
  session identifier mandated by the OTRv4 spec = sender and receiver's instance
    tags, and the query message or the whitespace tag
  phi' = session identifier defined by the implementer
  phi = session identifier mandated by the OTRv4 spec || phi'
```

In XMPP, for example, `Phi'` can be the node and domain parts of the sender and
receiver's jabber identifier, e.g. `alice@jabber.net` (often referred as the
"bare JID"). In an application that assigns some attribute to users before a
conversation (e.g., a networked game in which players take on specific roles),
the expected attributes (expressed in fixed length) should be included in
`phi'`. A static password shared by both sides can also be included.

For example, a shared session state which higher-level protocol is XMPP, will
look like this:

```
  phi = sender's instance tag || receiver's instance tag || query message ||
        sender's bare JID || receiver's bare JID
  phi = 0x00000100 || 0x00000101 || "?OTRv4?" || "alice@jabber.net" ||
        "bob@jabber.net"
```

### Secure Session ID

The secure session ID (`SSID`) is a 8-byte value. If the participant requests
to see it, it should be displayed as two 4-byte big-endian unsigned values. For
example, in C language, in "%08x" format. If the party transmitted the Auth-R
message during the DAKE, then display the first 4 bytes in bold, and the second
4 bytes in non-bold. If the party transmitted the Auth-I message instead,
display the first 4 bytes in non-bold, and the second 4 bytes in bold. If the
party transmitted the Non-Interactive-Auth message during the DAKE, then display
the first 4 bytes in bold, and the second 4 bytes in non-bold. If the party
received the Non-Interactive-Auth message instead, display the first 4 bytes
in non-bold, and the second 4 bytes in bold.

This Secure Session ID can be used by the parties to verify (over the telephone,
assuming the parties recognize each others' voices) that there is no
man-in-the-middle by having each side read his bold part to the other. Note that
this only needs to be done in the event that the participants do not trust that
their long-term keys have not been compromised.

### OTR Error Messages

Any message containing "?OTR Error: " at the starting position is an OTR Error
Message. The following part of the message should contain human-readable details
of the error. The message may also include a specific code at the beginning,
e.g. "?OTR Error: ERROR_N: ". This code is used to identify which error is being
received for optional localization of the message.

Currently, the following errors are supported:

```
  ERROR_1:
    Unreadable message
  ERROR_2:
    Not in private state message
```
Note that the string "?OTR Error:" must be in at the start position of the
message because of these reasons:

- The possibility for playing games with the state machine by "embedding" this
  string inside some other message.
- The potential of social engineering depending on the UI of the used chat
  client.

## Key Management

In both the interactive and non-interactive DAKEs, OTRv4 uses long-term Ed448
keys, ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keys, and ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys.

For exchanging data messages, OTRv4 uses KDF chains: the symmetric-key ratchet
and the DH ratchet (with ECDH) from the Double Ratchet algorithm
[\[2\]](#references). OTRv4 adds 3072-bit (384-byte) DH keys, called the brace
key pair, to the Double Ratchet algorithm. These keys are used to protect
transcripts of data messages in case ECC is broken. During the DAKE and
initialization of the Double Ratchet Algorithm, both parties agree upon the
first set of ECDH and DH keys. Then, during every third DH ratchet in the Double
Ratchet, a new DH key is agreed upon. Between each DH brace key ratchet, both
sides will conduct a symmetric brace key ratchet.

The following variables keep state as the ratchet moves forward:

```
State variables:
  i: the ratchet id.
  j: the sending message id.
  k: the receiving message id.
  pn: the number of messages in the previous DH ratchet.

Key variables:
  'root_key[i]': the root key for ratchet i.
  'chain_key_s[i][j]': the sending chain key for the sending message 'j' in
    ratchet 'i'.
  'chain_key_r[i][k]': the receiving chain key for the receiving message 'k' in
    ratchet 'i'.
  'our_ecdh': our current ECDH ephemeral key pair.
  'their_ecdh': their ECDH ephemeral public key.
  'our_dh': our DH ephemeral key pair.
  'their_dh': their DH ephemeral public key.
  'brace_key': either a hash of the shared DH key: 'KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)'
   (every thrid DH ratchet) or a hash of the previuos 'brace_key:
   KDF_1(0x03 || brace_key, 32)'
  'mac_keys_to_reveal': the MAC keys to be revealed in the first data message
    sent of the next ratchet.
  'skipped_MKenc': Dictionary of stored skipped-over message keys, indexed by
    their_ecdh, their_dh, the ratchet id ('i') and the message number ('j').
    Raises and exception if too many elements are stored.
  'max_skip' a constant that specifies the maximum number of message keys
    that can be skipped in a ratchet. It should be set by the implementer. Take
    into account that it should be set high enough to tolerate routine lost or
    delayed messages, but low enough that a malicious sender can't trigger
    excessive recipient computation.
```

Depending on the event, the state variables are incremented and some key
variable values are replaced:

* When you start a new [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by sending
  or receiving an [Identity Message](#identity-message).
* When you complete the [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by
  sending an [Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message).
* When you complete the [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by
  receiving and validating an [Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message).
* When you start a new [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  publishing or retrieving a [Prekey message](#prekey-message).
* When you complete a [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  sending a [Non-interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
* When you complete a [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  receiving and validating a
  [Non-interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
* When you [send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) or
  [receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message).
* When you [send a TLV type 1 (Disconnected)](#sending-a-tlv-type-1-disconnected-message).

### Generating ECDH and DH keys

```
generateECDH()
  - pick a random value r (57 bytes)
  - generate 'h' = KDF_1(0x01 || r, 57).
  - prune 'h': the two least significant bits of the first byte are cleared, all
    eight bits of the last byte are cleared, and the highest bit of the second
    to last byte is set.
  - Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming the secret scalar
    's'.
  - Securely delete 'r' and 'h'.
  - return our_ecdh.public = G * s, our_ecdh.secret = s

generateDH()
  - pick a random value r (80 bytes)
  - return our_dh.public = g3 ^ r, our_dh.secret = r
```

### Shared Secrets

```
k_dh:
  The 3072-bit DH shared secret computed from a DH exchange, serialized as a
  big-endian unsigned integer.

brace_key:
  Either a hash of the shared DH key: 'KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)' (every third
  DH ratchet) or a hash of the previuos 'brace_key: KDF_1(0x03 || brace_key, 32)'.

K_ecdh:
  The serialized ECDH shared secret computed from an ECDH exchange, serialized
  as a 'POINT'.

K:
  The Mixed shared secret is the final shared secret derived from both the
  brace key and ECDH shared secrets: 'KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)'.
```

### Generating Shared Secrets

```
ECDH(a, B)
  B * cofactor
  K_ecdh = a * B
  if K_ecdh == 0 (check that it is an all-zero value)
     return error
  else
     return K_ecdh
```

Check, without leaking extra information about the value of `K_ecdh`, whether
`K_ecdh` is the all-zero value and abort if so, as this process involves
contributory behavior. Contributory behaviour means that both parties' private
keys contribute to the resulting shared key. Since Ed448 have a cofactor of 4,
an input point of small order will eliminate any contribution from the other
party's private key. This situation can be detected by checking for the all-zero
output.

```
DH(a, B)
  return k_dh = a ^ B
```

### Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as sender

Before sending the first reply (i.e. a new message considering a previous
message has been received) or sending the first data message, the sender will
rotate their ECDH keys and their brace key. This is for the computation of the
Mixed shared secret `K` (see
[Deriving Double Ratchet Keys](#deriving-double-ratchet-keys)).

Before rotating the keys:

  * Reset the next message id (`j`) to 0.

To rotate the ECDH keys:

  * Generate a new ECDH key pair and assign it to `our_ecdh = generateECDH()`
    (by securely replacing the old value).
  * Calculate `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.

To rotate the brace key:

  * If `i % 3 == 0`:

    * Generate the new DH key pair and assign it to `our_dh = generateDH()`
      (by securely replacing the old value).
    * Calculate `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
    * Calculate a `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Derive and securely overwrite `brace_key = KDF_1(0x03 || brace_key, 32)`.

### Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as receiver

Every ratchet, the receiver will rotate their ECDH keys and their brace key.
This is for the computation of the Mixed shared secret `K` (see
[Deriving Double Ratchet Keys](#deriving-double-ratchet-keys)).

Before rotating the keys:

  * Reset the receiving message id (`k`) to 0.

To rotate the ECDH keys:

  * Retrieve the ECDH key ('Public ECDH key') from the received data message and
    assign it to `their_ecdh`.
  * Calculate `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
  * Securely delete `our_ecdh.secret`.

To rotate the brace key:

  * If `i % 3 == 0`:

    * Retrieve the DH key ('Public DH key') from the received data message and
      assign it to `their_dh`.
    * Calculate `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
    * Calculate a `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`.
    * Securely delete `our_dh.secret` and `k_dh`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Derive and securely overwrite `brace_key = KDF_1(0x03 || brace_key, 32)`.

### Deriving Double Ratchet Keys

To derive the next root key and the current chain key:

```
derive_ratchet_keys(purpose, root_key[i-1], K):
  root_key[i] = KDF_1(0x21 || root_key[i-1] || K, 64)
  chain_key_purpose[i][j] = KDF_1(0x22 || root_key[i-1] || K, 64)
  return root_key[i], chain_key_purpose[i][j]
```

### Calculating Encryption and MAC Keys

When sending or receiving data messages, you must calculate the message keys:

```
derive_enc_mac_keys(chain_key):
  MKenc = KDF_1(0x24 || chain_key, 32)
  MKmac = KDF_1(0x25 || MKenc, 64)
  return MKenc, MKmac
```

### Resetting State Variables and Key Variables

The state variables are set to `0` and the key variables are set to `NULL`.

### Session Expiration

OTRv4 can vulnerable to a situation when an attacker capture some messages to
compromise their ephemeral secrets at a later time. To mitigate against this,
message keys should be deleted regularly. OTRv4 implements this by detecting
whether a new ECDH key has been generated within a certain amount of time. If it
hasn't, the session is expired.

To expire a session:

1. Calculate the MAC keys corresponding to the stored message keys in the
   `skipped_MKenc` dictionary and put them on the `old_mac_keys` list (so they
   are revealed in TLV type 1 (Disconnected) message).
2. Send a TLV type 1 (Disconnected) message, with the `old_mac_keys` list
   attached to it.
3. Securely delete all keys and data associated with the conversation.
   This includes:

   1. The root key and all chain keys.
   2. All message keys and extra symmetric keys stored in the `skipped_MKenc`
      dictionary.
   3. The ECDH keys, DH keys and brace keys.
   4. The Secure Session ID (SSID) whose creation is described
      [here](#interactive-deniable-authenticated-key-exchange-dake)
      and [here](#non-interactive-auth-message),
      any old MAC keys that remain unrevealed, and the
      extra symmetric key if present.
   5. Reset the state and key variables, as defined in
      [its section](#resetting-state-variables-and-key-variables).

4. Transition the protocol state machine to `START`.

The session expiration time is decided individually by each party so it is
possible for one person to have an expiration time of two hours and the other
party have it of two weeks. The client implementer should decide what the
appropriate expiration time is for their particular circumstance.

The session expiration encourages keys to be deleted often at the cost of
having lost messages whose MAC keys cannot be revealed. For example, if Alice
sets her session expiration time to be 2 hours, in order to reset Alice's
session expiration timer, Bob must create a reply and Alice must create a
response to this reply. If this does not happen within two hours, Alice will
expire her session and delete all keys associated with this conversation. If
she receives a message from Bob after two hours, she will not be able to decrypt
the message and thus she will not reveal the MAC key associated with it. Note,
nevertheless, that the MAC keys corresponding to stored message keys (from
messages that have not yet arrived) will be derived and revealed in the TLV
type 1 that is sent.

It is also possible for the heartbeat messages to keep a session from expiring.
Sticking with the above example of Alice's 2 hour session expiration time, Bob
or Bob's client may send a heartbeat message every minute. In addition, Alice's
client may send a heartbeat every five minutes. Thus, as long as both Bob and
Alice's clients are online and sending heartbeat messages, Alice's session will
not expire. But if Bob's client turns off or goes offline for at least two
hours, Alice's session will expire.

The session expiration timer begins at different times for the sender and the
receiver of the first data message in a conversation. The sender begins their
timer as they send the first data message or as they attach an encrypted
message to the Non-Interactive-Auth message. The receiver begins their timer
when they receive this first data message or the attached encrypted message.

Since the session expiration uses a timer, it can be compromised by clock
errors. Some errors may cause the session to be deleted too early and result in
undecryptable messages being received. Other errors may result in the clock not
moving forward which would cause a session to never expire. To mitigate this,
implementers should use secure and reliable clocks that can't be manipulated by
an attacker.

## User Profile

OTRv4 introduces user profiles. The User Profile contains the Ed448 long term
public key, information about supported versions, a profile expiration date, a
signature of all these, and an optional transitional signature.

There are two instances of the User Profile that should be generated. One is
used for authentication in both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive). The
other should be published in a public place to achieve deniability properties.
This procedure allows two parties to send and verify each other's signed User
Profile during the DAKE without damaging participation deniability for the
conversation, since the signed profile is public information.

Each implementation should decide how to publish the profile. For example, one
client may publish profiles to a server pool (similar to a keyserver pool,
where PGP public keys can be published). Another client may use XMPP's publish-
subscribe extension (XEP-0060 [\[8\]](#references)) for publishing profiles. A
protocol for publication must be defined, but the definition is out of scope
for this specification.

When the User Profile expires, it should be updated. Client implementations
should determine the frequency of user's profile expiration and renewal. The
recommended expiration time is one week. Note, though, that the long term public
key has its own expiration time.

It is also important to note that the absence of a User Profile is not a proof
that a user does not support OTRv4.

Note that a User Profile is generated per client and device basis. Users are not
expected to manage user profiles (theirs or from others) in a client. As a
consequence, clients are discouraged to allow importing or exporting of user
profiles. Also, if a user has multiple clients/devices concurrently in use, it
is expected that they have multiple user profiles simultaneously published and
valid.

### User Profile Data Type

```
Profile Expiration (USER-PROF-EXP):
  8 byte signed value, big-endian

User Profile (USER-PROF):
  Ed448 public key (ED448-PUBKEY)
    Corresponds to 'H'.
  Versions (DATA)
  Profile Expiration (USER-PROF-EXP)
  (optional) Transitional Signature (USER-SIG)
  Profile Signature (USER-EDDSA-SIG)
```

`USER-EDDSA-SIG` refers to the OTRv4 EDDSA signature:

```
EDDSA signature (USER-EDDSA-SIG):
  (len is the expected length of the signature, which is 114 bytes)
  len byte unsigned value, little-endian
```

`SIG` is the DSA Signature. It is the same signature as used in OTRv3.
From the OTRv3 protocol, section "Public keys, signatures, and fingerprints",
the format for a signature made by a OTRv3 DSA public key is as follows:

```
DSA signature (USER-SIG):
  (len is the length of the DSA public parameter q, which in current
  implementations is 20 bytes)
  len byte unsigned r, big-endian
  len byte unsigned s, big-endian
```

As defined in OTRv3 spec, the OTRv3 DSA public key is defined as:

```
OTRv3 public authentication DSA key (PUBKEY):
  Pubkey type (SHORT)
    DSA public keys have type 0x0000
  p (MPI)
  q (MPI)
  g (MPI)
  y (MPI)
(p,q,g,y) are the OTRv3 DSA public key parameters
```

### Creating a User Profile

To create a User Profile, assemble:

1. User's Ed448 long-term public key.
2. Versions: a string corresponding to the user's supported OTR versions.
   A User Profile can advertise multiple OTR versions. The format is described
   under the section [Establishing Versions](#establishing-versions) below.
3. Profile Expiration: Expiration date in standard Unix 64-bit format
   (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring leap
   seconds).
4. Profile Signature: The symmetric key, the flag `f` (set to zero, as defined
   on RFC 8032 [\[9\]](#references)) and the empty context `c` are used to
   create signatures of the entire profile excluding the signature itself. The
   size of the signature is 114 bytes. For its generation, refer to
   [Create a User Profile Signature](#create-a-user-profile-signature) section.
5. Transitional Signature (optional): A signature of the profile excluding the
   Profile Signature and the user's OTRv3 DSA key. The Transitional Signature
   enables parties that trust user's version 3 DSA key to trust the user's
   profile in version 4. This is only used if the user supports versions 3
   and 4. For more information, refer to
   [Create a User Profile Signature](#create-a-user-profile-signature) section.

After the profile is created, it must be published in a public place, like an
untrusted server, as defined above.

### Establishing Versions

A valid versions string can be created by concatenating supported version
numbers together in any order. For example, a user who supports versions 3 and 4
will have the 2-byte version string "43" or "34" in their profile. A user who
only supports version 4 will have the 1-byte version string "4". Thus, a version
string has varying size, and it is represented as a DATA type with its length
specified.

A compliant OTRv4 implementation (in OTRv43-compatible mode) is required to
support version 3 of OTR, but not versions 1 and 2. Therefore, invalid version
strings contain a "2" or a "1".

Any other version string that is not "4", "3", "2", or "1" should be ignored.

### User Profile Expiration and Renewal

If a renewed user profile is not published in a public place, the user's
participation deniability is at risk. Participation deniability is also at risk
if the only publicly available user profile is expired. For that reason, a
received expired user profile during the DAKE is considered invalid.

Before the profile expires, the user must publish an updated user profile with a
new expiration date. The client establishes the frequency of expiration and
when to publish (before the current User Profile expires). Note that this can be
configurable. A recommended value is one week.

### Create a User Profile Signature

If version 3 and 4 are supported and the user has a pre-existing OTRv3 long
term key:

   * Concatenate `Ed448 public key || Versions || Profile Expiration || Public
     Shared Prekey`. Denote this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the user's OTRv3 DSA key. Denote this value
     `Transitional Signature`.
   * Sign `m || Transitional Signature`  with the symmetric key, as stated
     below. Denote this value `Profile Signature`.

If only version 4 is supported:

   * Concatenate `Ed448 public key || Versions || Profile Expiration || Public
     Shared Prekey`. Denote this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the symmetric key, as stated below. Denote this value
     `Profile Signature`.

The User Profile signature for version 4 is generated as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.6. The flag `f` is set to `0` and the context
`c` is an empty constant string.

Note that, although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are
defined as bytes here.

It is generated as follows:

```
The inputs are the symmetric key (57 bytes, defined in the 'Public keys and
fingerprints' section. It is referred as 'sym_key'), a flag 'f', which is a byte
with value 0, a context 'c' (a value set by the signer and verifier of maximum
255 bytes), which is an empty string for this protocol, and a message 'm'.

1.  Hash the 'sym_key': 'KDF_2(sym_key, 114)'. Let 'h' denote the resulting
    digest. Construct the secret key 'sk' from the first half of 'h' (57 bytes),
    and the corresponding public key 'H', as defined in the 'Public keys, Shared
    Prekeys and Fingerprints' section. Let 'prefix' denote the second half of
    the 'h' (from 'h[57]' to 'h[113]').

2.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || prefix || m, 114), where
    'm' is the message to be signed. Let 'r' be the 114-byte resulting digest
    and interpret it as a little-endian integer.

3.  Multiply the scalar 'r' by the Base Point (G). For efficiency, do this by
    first reducing 'r' modulo 'q', the group order.  Let 'R' be the encoding
    of this resulting point. It should be encoded as a POINT.

4.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114). Interpret
    the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

5.  Compute 'S = (r + k * sk) mod q'.  For efficiency, reduce 'k' again modulo
    'q' first.

6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of 'R' (57 bytes) and the
    little-endian encoding of 'S' (57 bytes, the ten most significant bits are
    always zero).

7. Securely delete 'sk', 'h', 'r' and 'k'.
```

### Verify a User Profile Signature

The User Profile signature is verified as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.7. It works as follows:

```
1.  To verify a signature on a message 'm', using the public key 'H', with 'f'
    being 0, and 'c' being empty, split the signature into two 57-byte halves.
    Decode the first half as a point 'R', and the second half as a scalar
    'S'. Decode the public key 'H' as a point 'H_1'. If any of the
    decodings fail (including 'S' being out of range), the signature is invalid.

2.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114). Interpret
    the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

3.  Check the group equation '4 * (S * G) = (4 * R) + (4 * (k * H_1))'. It's is
    sufficient to check '(S * G) = R + (k * H_1)'.
```

### Validating a User Profile

To validate a User Profile, you must (in this order):

1. Verify that the User Profile has not expired.
2. Verify that the `Versions` field contains the character "4".
3. Validate that the `Public Shared Prekey` and the `Ed448 Public Key` are on
   the curve Ed448-Goldilocks. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
3. If the `Transitional Signature` is present, verify its validity using the
   OTRv3 DSA key.
4. [Verify that the User Profile signature is valid](#verify-a-user-profile-signature).

## Prekey Profile

OTRv4 introduces prekey profiles. The Prekey Profile contains a shared prekey, a
prekey profile expiration date, a signature of all these, and an optional
transitional signature. It is signed by the Ed448 long-term public key and/or
the OTRv3 DSA key.

A prekey profile is needed for it's signed shared prekey, which is used for
offline conversations. It is changed on a regular basis as defined by the
expiration date of the prekey profile.

There are two instances of the Prekey Profile that should be generated. One is
used for publication in an untrusted prekey server, so parties can use it
to send offline messages. The other should be stored locally.

When the Prekey Profile expires, it should be updated. Client implementations
should determine the frequency of the prekey's profile expiration and renewal.
The recommended expiration time is one week.

Note that a Prekey Profile is generated per client and device basis. Users are
not expected to manage prekey profiles (theirs or from others) in a client. As a
consequence, clients are discouraged to allow importing or exporting of prekey
profiles. Also, if a user has multiple clients/devices concurrently in use, it
is expected that they have multiple prekey profiles simultaneously published and
valid.

### Prekey Profile Data Type

```
Prekey Profile Expiration (PREKEY-PROF-EXP):
  8 byte signed value, big-endian

Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF):
  Prekey Profile Expiration (PREKEY-PROF-EXP)
  Public Shared Prekey (ED448-SHARED-PREKEY)
    The shared prekey used between different prekey messages.
    Corresponds to 'D'.
  (optional) Prekey Transitional Signature (PREKEY-SIG)
  Prekey Profile Signature (PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG)
```

`PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG` refers to the OTRv4 EDDSA signature:

```
PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG signature (PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG):
  (len is the expected length of the signature, which is 114 bytes)
  len byte unsigned value, little-endian
```

`PREKEY-SIG` is the DSA Signature. It is the same signature as used in OTRv3.
From the OTRv3 protocol, section "Public keys, signatures, and fingerprints",
the format for a signature made by a OTRv3 DSA public key is as follows:

```
DSA signature (PREKEY-SIG):
  (len is the length of the DSA public parameter q, which in current
  implementations is 20 bytes)
  len byte unsigned r, big-endian
  len byte unsigned s, big-endian
```

As defined in OTRv3 spec, the OTRv3 DSA public key is defined as:

```
OTRv3 public authentication DSA key (PUBKEY):
  Pubkey type (SHORT)
    DSA public keys have type 0x0000
  p (MPI)
  q (MPI)
  g (MPI)
  y (MPI)
(p,q,g,y) are the OTRv3 DSA public key parameters
```

### Creating a Prekey Profile

To create a Prekey Profile, assemble:

1. Prekey Profile Expiration: Expiration date in standard Unix 64-bit format
   (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring leap
   seconds).
4. Public Shared Prekey: An Ed448 Public Key used in multiple prekey messages.
   It adds partial protection against an attacker that modifies the first flow
   of the non-interactive DAKE and that compromises the receivers long term
   secret key and their one-time ephemeral keys. For its generation, refer to
   [Public keys, Shared Prekeys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-and-fingerprints)
   section. This key must expire when the Prekey Profile expires.
5. Profile Signature: The symmetric key, the flag `f` (set to zero, as defined
   on RFC 8032 [\[9\]](#references)) and the empty context `c` are used to
   create signatures of the entire profile excluding the signature itself. The
   size of the signature is 114 bytes. For its generation, refer to the
   [Create a Prekey Profile Signature](#create-a-prekey-profile-signature)
   section.
6. Transitional Signature (optional): A signature of the profile excluding the
   Profile Signature and the user's OTRv3 DSA key. The Transitional Signature
   enables parties that trust user's version 3 DSA key to trust the user's
   profile in version 4. This is only used if the user supports versions 3
   and 4. For more information, refer to the
   [Create a Prekey Profile Signature](#create-a-prekey-profile-signature)
   section.

After the prekey profile is created, it must be published in an untrusted
server.

### Prekey Profile Expiration and Renewal

Before the prekey profile expires, the user must publish an updated prekey
profile with a new expiration date. The client establishes the frequency of
expiration and when to publish (before the current Prekey Profile expires). Note
that this can be configurable. A recommended value is one week.

### Create a Prekey Profile Signature

If version 3 and 4 are supported, and the user has a pre-existing OTRv3 long
term key:

   * Concatenate `Prekey Profile Expiration || Public Shared Prekey`. Denote
     this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the user's OTRv3 DSA key. Denote this value
     `Prekey Transitional Signature`.
   * Sign `m || Prekey Transitional Signature`  with the symmetric key, as
     stated below. Denote this value `Prekey Profile Signature`.

If only version 4 is supported:

   * Concatenate `Profile Expiration || Public Shared Prekey`.
     Denote this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the symmetric key, as stated below. Denote this value
     `Profile Signature`.

The Prekey Profile signature for version 4 is generated as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.6. The flag `f` is set to `0` and the context
`c` is an empty constant string.

Note that, although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are
defined as bytes here.

It is generated as follows:

```
The inputs are the symmetric key (57 bytes, defined in the 'Public keys and
fingerprints' section. It is referred as 'sym_key'), a flag 'f', which is a byte
with value 0, a context 'c' (a value set by the signer and verifier of maximum
255 bytes), which is an empty string for this protocol, and a message 'm'.

1.  Hash the 'sym_key': 'KDF_2(sym_key, 114)'. Let 'h' denote the resulting
    digest. Construct the secret key 'sk' from the first half of 'h' (57 bytes),
    and the corresponding public key 'H', as defined in the 'Public keys, Shared
    Prekeys and Fingerprints' section. Let 'prefix' denote the second half of
    the 'h' (from 'h[57]' to 'h[113]').

2.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || prefix || m, 114), where
    'm' is the message to be signed. Let 'r' be the 114-byte resulting digest
    and interpret it as a little-endian integer.

3.  Multiply the scalar 'r' by the Base Point (G). For efficiency, do this by
    first reducing 'r' modulo 'q', the group order.  Let 'R' be the encoding
    of this resulting point. It should be encoded as a POINT.

4.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114). Interpret
    the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

5.  Compute 'S = (r + k * sk) mod q'.  For efficiency, reduce 'k' again modulo
    'q' first.

6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of 'R' (57 bytes) and the
    little-endian encoding of 'S' (57 bytes, the ten most significant bits are
    always zero).

7. Securely delete 'sk', 'h', 'r' and 'k'.
```

### Verify a Prekey Profile Signature

The Prekey Profile signature is verified as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.7. It works as follows:

```
1.  To verify a signature on a message 'm', using the public key 'H', with 'f'
    being 0, and 'c' being empty, split the signature into two 57-byte halves.
    Decode the first half as a point 'R', and the second half as a scalar
    'S'. Decode the public key 'H' as a point 'H_1'. If any of the
    decodings fail (including 'S' being out of range), the signature is invalid.

2.  Compute KDF_2("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114). Interpret
    the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

3.  Check the group equation '4 * (S * G) = (4 * R) + (4 * (k * H_1))'. It's is
    sufficient to check '(S * G) = R + (k * H_1)'.
```

### Validating a Prekey Profile

To validate a Prekey Profile, you must (in this order):

1. Verify that the Prekey Profile has not expired.
2. Validate that the `Public Shared Prekey` is on the curve Ed448-Goldilocks.
   See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
3. If the `Transitional Signature` is present, verify its validity using the
   OTRv3 DSA key.
4. [Verify that the Prekey Profile signature is valid](#verify-a-prekey-profile-signature).

## Online Conversation Initialization

Online OTRv4 conversations are initialized through a [Query Message or a
Whitespace Tag](#user-requests-to-start-an-otr-conversation). After this, the
conversation is authenticated using the interactive DAKE.

### Requesting Conversation with Older OTR Versions

Bob might respond to Alice's request (or notification of willingness to start a
conversation) using OTRv3. If this is the case and Alice supports version 3, the
protocol falls back to OTRv3 [\[7\]](#references). If Alice does not support
version 3, this response is ignored.

### Interactive Deniable Authenticated Key Exchange (DAKE)

This section outlines the flow of the interactive DAKE. This is a way to
mutually agree upon shared keys for the two parties and authenticate one another
while providing participation deniability.

This protocol is derived from the DAKEZ protocol [\[1\]](#references), which
uses a ring signature non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge
(`RING-SIG`) for authentication (`RSig`).

Alice's long-term Ed448 key pair is `(sk_ha, Ha)` and Bob's long-term Ed448
key pair is `(sk_hb, Hb)`. Both key pairs are generated as stated in the
[Public keys, shared prekeys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-and-fingerprints)
section.

#### Interactive DAKE Overview

```
Alice                                           Bob
---------------------------------------------------
       Query Message or Whitespace Tag -------->
       <----------------------- Identity message
       Auth-R --------------------------------->
       <--------------------------------- Auth-I
```

Bob will be initiating the DAKE with Alice.

**Bob:**

1. Generates an Identity message, as defined in
   [Identity Message](#identity-message) section.
2. Sets `Y` and `y` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
3. Sets `B` as  and `b` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
4. Sends Alice the Identity message.

**Alice:**

1. Receives an Identity message from Bob:
    * Verifies the Identity message as defined in the
      [Identity message](#identity-message) section. If the verification fails
      (for example, if Bob's public keys -`Y` or `B`- are not valid), rejects
      the message and does not send anything further.
    * Picks the newest compatible version of OTR listed in Bob's profile. If
      there aren't any compatible versions, Alice does not send any further
      messages.
    * Sets `Y` as `their_ecdh`.
    * Sets `B` as `their_dh`.
2. Generates an Auth-R message, as defined in
   [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section.
3. Sets `X` and `x` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
4. Sets `A` and `a` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
5. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
    * Calculates ECDH shared secret
      `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`. Securely deletes
       `our_ecdh.secret`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`.
    * Calculates the brace key `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`. Securely
      deletes `k_dh`.
    * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
      `K = KDF_1(0x04 ||K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
      Securely deletes `K_ecdh` and `brace_key`.
    * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `KDF_1(0x05 || K, 8)`.
6. Sends Bob the Auth-R message (see [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section).

**Bob:**

1. Receives the Auth-R message from Alice:
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed on Alice's profile, and follows
     the specification for this version. If the versions are incompatible, Bob
     does not send any further messages.
2. Retrieves the ephemeral public keys from Alice:
    * Validates that the received ECDH ephemeral public key `X` is on curve
      Ed448 and sets it as `their_ecdh`.
      See [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
      section for details.
    * Validates that the received DH ephemeral public key `A` is on the correct
      group and sets it as `their_dh`. See
      [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
      section for details.
3. Verifies the Auth-R message as defined in the
   [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section.
4. Creates an Auth-I message (see [Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message) section).
5. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
    * Calculates ECDH shared secret
      `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_ecdh.secret`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`.
    * Calculates the brace key `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`.
      Securely deletes `k_dh`.
    * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
      `K = KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
      Securely deletes `k_ecdh` and `brace_key`.
    * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `KDF_1(0x05 || K, 8)`.
6. Initializes the double-ratchet:
    * Sets ratchet id `i` as 0.
    * Sets `j` as 0, `k` as 0 and `pn` as 0.
    * Generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
      [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
      of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x19 || K, 57)`.
      Securely replaces `our_ecdh` with the outputs.
    * Generates an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
      [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
      of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x20 || K, 80)`.
      Securely replaces `our_dh` with the outputs.
    * Securely deletes `their_ecdh` and `their_dh`.
7. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Bob, but the double
   ratchet algorithm still needs to be correctly set up.

**Alice:**

1. Receives the Auth-I message from Bob:
   * Verifies the Auth-I message as defined in the
     [Auth-I message](#auth-i-message) section.
2. Initializes the double ratchet algorithm:
   * Sets ratchet id `i` as 0.
   * Sets `j` as 0, `k` as 0 and `pn` as 0.
   * Generates Bob's ECDH and DH public keys:
      * Generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
        [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
        of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x19 || K, 57)`.
        Securely replaces `their_ecdh` with the output
        `our_ecdh.public (G * s)` and securely deletes the output
        `our_ecdh.secret (s)`.
      * Generates an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
        [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
        of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x20 || K, 80)`.
        Securely replaces `their_dh` with the output
        `our_dh.public (g3 ^ r)` and securely deletes the output
        `our_dh.secret (r)`.
3. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Alice:
   * In the case that she wants to immediately send a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that she will perform a new DH ratchet.

**Bob:**

1. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Bob, but he has to
   correctly setup the double ratchet logarithm:
   * In the case that he immediately receives a data message that advertises the
     new public keys from Alice:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message)
       section. Note that he will perform a new DH ratchet for the first
       received data message. When he wants to send a data message after
       receiving one, he will follow the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section,
       and perform a new DH Ratchet.

#### Identity Message

This is the first message of the DAKE. It is sent to commit to a choice of ECDH
and DH key.

A valid Identity message is generated as follows:

1. Create a User Profile, as defined in
   [Creating a User Profile](#creating-a-user-profile) section.
2. Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `y` (57 bytes).
   * public key `Y`.
3. Generate an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `b` (80 bytes).
   * public key `B`.
4. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
   Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as the
   sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
   messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will have this
   number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify an Identity message:

1. Verify if the message type is `0x08`.
2. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
3. Validate the User Profile, as defined in
   [Validating a User Profile](#validating-a-user-profile) section.
4. Verify that the point `Y` received is on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
5. Verify that the DH public key `B` is from the correct group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.

An Identity message is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x08.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient. As the instance tag is used to
  differentiate the clients that a participant uses, this will often be 0 since
  the other party may not have set its instance tag yet.

Sender's User Profile (USER-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a User Profile".

Y (POINT)
  The ephemeral public ECDH key.

B (MPI)
  The ephemeral public DH key. Note that even though this is in uppercase, this
  is NOT a POINT.
```

#### Auth-R Message

This is the second message of the DAKEZ. It is sent to commit to a choice of a
ECDH ephemeral key and a DH ephemeral key, and to acknowledge the other
participant's ECDH ephemeral key and DH ephemeral key. This acknowledgment
includes a validation that other participant's ECDH key is on curve Ed448 and
that its DH key is in the correct group.

A valid Auth-R message is generated as follows:

1. Create a User Profile, as detailed as defined in
   [Creating a User Profile](#creating-a-user-profile) section.
2. Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `x` (57 bytes).
   * public key `X`.
3. Generate an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `a` (80 bytes).
   * public key `A`.
4. Compute
   `t = 0x0 || KDF_1(0x06 || Bobs_User_Profile, 64) ||
    KDF_1(0x07 || Alices_User_Profile, 64) || Y || X || B || A ||
    KDF_1(0x08 || phi, 64)`.
   `phi` is the shared session state as mention in its
   [section](#shared-session-state).
5. Compute `sigma = RSig(H_a, sk_ha, {H_b, H_a, Y}, t)`, as defined in
   [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication).
6. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
   Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as the
   sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
   messages. For the other party, this will be the receiver's instance tag.
7. Use the sender's instance tag from the Identity Message as the receiver's
   instance tag.

To verify an Auth-R message:

1. Verify if the message type is `0x91`.
2. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
3. Check that the receiver's instance tag matches your sender's instance tag.
4. Validate the User Profile as defined in
   [Validating a User Profile](#validating-a-user-profile) section.
   Extract `H_a` from it.

   KDF_1(0x07 || Alices_User_Profile, 64) || Y || X || B || A ||
   KDF_1(0x08 || phi, 64)`. `phi` is the shared session state as mention in its
   [section](#shared-session-state).
6. Verify the `sigma` with
   [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication), that is
   `sigma == RVrf({H_b, H_a, Y}, t)`.

An Auth-R message is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

  is NOT a POINT.

sigma (RING-SIG)
  The 'RING-SIG' proof of authentication value.
```

#### Auth-I Message

This is the final message of the DAKE. It is sent to verify the authentication
`sigma`.

A valid Auth-I message is generated as follows:

1. Compute
   `t = 0x1 || KDF_1(0x09 || Bobs_User_Profile, 64) ||
    KDF_1(0x10 || Alices_User_Profile, 64) || Y || X || B || A ||

```

## Offline Conversation Initialization

To begin an offline conversation, a Prekey message is published to an untrusted
server. This action is considered as the start of the non-interactive DAKE. A
Prekey message is retrieved by the party attempting to send a message to the
Prekey's publisher. This participant, then, replies with a Non-Interactive-Auth
message (created with the prekey's values). This action is considered to
complete the non-interactive DAKE.

### Non-interactive Deniable Authenticated Key Exchange (DAKE)

The non-interactive DAKE is a method by which two parties mutually agree upon
shared cryptographic keys while providing partial participation deniability.
Unlike the interactive DAKE, the non-interactive DAKE does not provide online
deniability for the party that completes the DAKE by sending a
Non-Interactive-Auth message. Client implementations are expected to understand
this deniability risk when allowing participantss to complete a non-interactive
DAKE. They are also expected to decide how to convey this security loss to the
participant.

This protocol is derived from the XZDH protocol [\[1\]](#references), which uses
a ring signature non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (`RING-SIG`)
for authentication (`RSig`).

Alice's long-term Ed448 key pair is `(sk_ha, H_a)` and Bob's long-term Ed448 key
pair is `(sk_hb, H_b)`. Both key pairs are generated as stated in the
[Public keys, Shared prekeys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-and-fingerprints)
section.

#### Non-Interactive DAKE Overview

```
Bob                            Server                               Alice
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Publish a Prekey message ---->
								....
                                     <----- Request Prekey messages from Bob

      <---------------------------------------- Non-Interactive-Auth message
Verify. Decrypt message if included
```

**Bob:**

1. Generates a Prekey message, as defined in
   [Prekey Message](#prekey-message) section.
2. Sets `Y` and `y` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
3. Sets `B` as  and `b` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
4. Publishes the Prekey message to an untrusted server.

**Alice:**

1. Requests prekey messages from the untrusted server.
2. For each Prekey message received from the server:
   * [Validates each Prekey Message](#validating-prekey-messages).
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed in Bob's profile.
     If the versions are incompatible, Alice does not send any further
     messages.
   * Sets the received ECDH ephemeral public key `Y` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets the received DH ephemeral public key `B` as `their_dh`.
3. Extracts the Public Shared Prekey (`D_b`) from Bob's Prekey Profile. Extracts
   the Ed448 public key (`H_b`) from Bob's User Profile. Sets the first as
   `their_shared_prekey`.
4. Generates a Non-Interactive-Auth message. See
   [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section.
5. Sets `X` and `x` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
6. Sets `A` and `a` as `our_dh`: ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
7. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
   * Gets `tmp_k` from the
     [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
   * Calculates the Mixed shared secret `K = KDF_1(0x04 || tmp_k, 64)`.
     Securely deletes `tmp_k`.
   * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `KDF_1(0x05 || K, 8)`.
8. Initializes the double-ratchet:
   * Sets ratchet id `i` as 0.
   * Sets `j` as 0, `k` as 0 and `pn` as 0.
   * Generates Bob's ECDH and DH public keys:
     * Generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
       [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
       of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x19, K, 57)`.
       Securely replaces `their_ecdh` with the output
       `our_ecdh.public (G * s)` and securely deletes the output
       `our_ecdh.secret (s)`.
     * Generates an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
       [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
       of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x20, K, 80)`.
       Securely replaces `their_dh` with the output
       `our_dh.public (g3 ^ r)` and securely deletes the output
       `our_dh.secret (r)`.
9. At this point, she can attach an encrypted message to the
   Non-Interactive-Auth message:
   * Follows what is defined in the
     [Attaching an Encrypted Message to the Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#attaching-an-encrypted-message-to-non-interactive-auth-message-in-xzdh)
     section.
10. Calculates the `Auth MAC`:
    * If an encrypted message is attached, she computes:

      ```
        Auth MAC = KDF_1(0x18 || auth_mac_k || t || (KDF_1(0x17 ||
                   attached encrypted ratchet id ||
                   attached encrypted message id || public ecdh key ||
                   public dh key || nonce || encrypted message, 64)), 64)`.
      ```

    * Otherwise, she computes:

      ```
        Auth MAC = KDF_1(0x18 || auth_mac_k || t, 64)
      ```

    * Includes this value in the Non-Interactive-Auth message and securely
      deletes the `auth_mac_k`.
11. Sends Bob a Non-Interactive-Auth message. See
    [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section.
12. At this point, the non-interactive DAKE is complete for Alice:
    * In the case that she wants to immediately send a data message:
      * Follows what is defined in the
        [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message)
        section. Note that she will perform a new DH ratchet if no encrypted
        message was attached to the Non-Interactive-Auth message.

**Bob:**

1. Receives the Non-Interactive-Auth message from Alice:
   * Validates Alice's User Profile and extracts `H_a` from it.
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed on Alice's profile, and follows
     the specification for this version. If the versions are incompatible, Bob
     does not send any further messages.
   * Sets his Public Shared Prekey (`D_b`) from his User Profile as
     `our_shared_prekey.public`.
   * Verifies the Non-Interactive-Auth message. See
     [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section.
2. Retrieves the ephemeral public keys from Alice:
   * Sets the received ECDH ephemeral public key `X` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets the received DH ephemeral public key `A` as `their_dh`.
3. Calculates the keys needed for the generation of the Mixed shared secret
   (`K`):
   * Calculates the ECDH shared secret
     `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`. Securely deletes
     `our_ecdh.secret`.
   * Calculates the DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
     Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`.
   * Calculates the brace key `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`.
     Securely deletes `k_dh`.
4. Calculates
   `tmp_k = KDF_1(0x12 || K_ecdh || ECDH(our_shared_prekey.secret, their_ecdh)
    || ECDH(sk_hb, their_ecdh) || brace_key, 64)`.
5. Computes the Auth MAC key `auth_mac_k = KDF_1(0x14 || tmp_k, 64)`.
6. Computes the Mixed shared secret and the SSID:
   * `K = KDF_1(0x04 || tmp_k, 64)`. Securely deletes `tmp_k`.
   * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `KDF_1(0x05 || K, 8)`.
7. Initializes the double ratchet algorithm:
   * Sets ratchet id `i` as 0.
   * Sets `j` as 0, `k` as 0 and `pn` as 0.
   * Generates an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
     [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
     of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x19, K, 57)`.
     Securely replaces `our_ecdh` with the outputs.
   * Generates an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
     [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys), but instead
     of using a random value `r`, it will use : `r = KDF_1(0x20, K, 80)`.
     Securely replaces `our_dh` with the outputs.
   * If an encrypted message was attached to the Non-Interactive-Auth message:
     * Follows what is defined in [Decrypting an Attached Encrypted Message](#decrypting-the-message)
       section.
     * Otherwise:
        * Computes `Auth MAC = KDF_1(0x18 || auth_mac_k || t, 64)`.
          The `t` value here is the one computed during the verification of the
          Non-Interactive-Auth message.
   * Extracts the `Auth MAC` from the Non-Interactive-Auth message and verifies
     that it is equal to the one just calculated. If it is not, ignore the
     Non-Interactive-Auth message.
8. At this point, the non-interactive DAKE is complete for Bob:
   * In the case that he immediately receives a data message that advertises the
     new public keys from Alice:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message)
       section. Note that he will perform a new DH ratchet if no encrypted
       message was attached to the Non-Interactive-Auth message. When he wants
       to send a data message after receiving one, he will follow the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section,
       and perform a new DH Ratchet.

#### Prekey message

This message is created and published to an unstrusted prekey server to allow
offline conversations. Each Prekey message contains the owner's User Profile
(which contains a signed shared prekey) and two one-time use ephemeral public
prekey values.

A valid Prekey message is generated as follows:

1. Create a User Profile, as defined in
   [Creating a User Profile](#creating-a-user-profile) section.
2. Create a Prekey Profile, as defined in
   [Creating a Prekey Profile](#creating-a-prekey-profile) section.
3. Create the first one-time use prekey by generating the ephemeral ECDH key
   pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `y` (57 bytes).
   * public key `Y`.
4. Create the second one-time use prekey by generating the ephemeral DH key
   pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `b` (80 bytes).
   * public key `B`.
5. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
   Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as the
   sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
   messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will have this
   number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify a Prekey message:

1. Verify if the message type is `0x0F`.
2. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
3. [Validate the User Profile](#validating-a-user-profile).
4. [Validate the Prekey Profile](#validating-a-prekey-profile). Check that the
   prekey profile' signature was generated by using the Ed448 long-term public
   key stated in the User Profile.
5. Check that the ECDH public key `Y` is on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
6. Verify that the DH public key `B` is from the correct group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.

A Prekey is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x0F.

Prekey owner's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the client that created the prekey.

Prekey owner's User Profile (USER-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a User Profile".

Prekey owner's Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a Prekey Profile".

Y Prekey owner's ECDH public key (POINT)
  First one-time use prekey value.

B Prekey owner's DH public key (MPI)
  Second one-time use prekey value. The ephemeral public DH key. Note that even
  though this is in uppercase, this is NOT a POINT.

```

#### Non-Interactive-Auth Message

This message finishes the non-interactive DAKE. It contains a key-only
unforgeable message authentication code function. Bob sends it to Alice to
commit to a choice of his ECDH ephemeral key and his DH ephemeral key, and to
acknowledge Alice's ECDH ephemeral key and DH ephemeral key. This message might
also contain an attached encrypted message, which is highly recommended.

A valid Non-Interactive-Auth message is generated as follows:

1. Create a User Profile, as defined in
   [Creating a User Profile](#creating-a-user-profile) section.
2. Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `x` (57 bytes).
   * public key `X`.
3. Generate an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `a` (80 bytes).
   * public key `A`.
4. Compute `K_ecdh = ECDH(x, their_ecdh)`.
5. Compute `k_dh = DH(a, their_dh)` and `brace_key = KDF_1(0x02 || k_dh, 32)`.
6. Compute
   `tmp_k = KDF_1(0x12 || K_ecdh || ECDH(x, their_shared_prekey) ||
    ECDH(x, H_b) || brace_key, 64)`.
   This value is needed for the generation of the Mixed shared secret.
7. Calculate the Auth MAC key `auth_mac_k = KDF_1(0x13 || tmp_k, 64)`.
8. Compute
   `t = KDF_1(0x14 || Bobs_User_Profile, 64) ||
    KDF_1(0x15 || Alices_User_Profile, 64) || Y || X || B || A ||
    their_shared_prekey || KDF_1(0x16 || phi, 64)`.
9. Compute `sigma = RSig(H_a, sk_ha, {H_b, H_a, Y}, t)`. When computing `sigma`,
   keep the first 24 bytes of the generated `c` value to be used as a `nonce`
   in the next step. Refer to
   [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication) for details.
10. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
    Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as
    the sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
    messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will have this
    number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify a Non-Interactive-Auth message:

1. Verify if the message type is `0x8D`.
2. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
3. Check that the receiver's instance tag matches your sender's instance tag.
4. Validate the received ECDH ephemeral public key `X` is on curve Ed448.
   See [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
5. Validate that the received DH ephemeral public key `A` is on the correct
   group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.
6. Compute
   `t = KDF_1(0x14 || Bobs_User_Profile, 64) ||
    KDF_1(0x15 ||Alices_User_Profile, 64) ||
    Y || X || B || A || our_shared_prekey.public || KDF_1(0x16 || phi, 64)`.
7. Verify the `sigma` as defined in
   [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication).

A Non-Interactive-Auth is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x8D.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient.

Sender's User Profile (USER-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a User Profile".

X (POINT)
  The ephemeral public ECDH key.

A (MPI)
  The ephemeral public DH key. Note that even though this is in uppercase, this
  is NOT a POINT.

Sigma (RING-SIG)
  The 'RING-SIG' proof of authentication value.

Attached XZDH Encrypted Message (XZDH-ENCRYPTED-MSG)
  (optional: if an encrypted message is attached)
  The XZDH-ENCRYPTED-MSG that consists of an attached encrypted ratchet id, an
  attached message id, a public ECDH key (used for encrypting the message), a
  public DH key (used for encrypting the message), a 'nonce' and the encrypted
  message.

Auth MAC (MAC)
  The MAC with the appropriate MAC key (see above) of the message ('t') for the
  Ring Signature ('RING-SIG'). When an encrypted message is attached, this is
  also the MAC of that message.
```

#### Publishing Prekey Messages

An OTRv4 client must generate a user's prekey messages and publish them to a
prekey server. Implementers are expected to create their own policy dictating
how often their clients upload prekey messages to the prekey server. Prekey
messages expire when their User Profile and/or the Prekey Profile expires. Thus
new prekey messages should be published to the prekey server before they expire
to keep valid prekey messages available. In addition, one Prekey message should
be published for every long term key that belongs to a participant. This means
that if Bob uploads 3 long term keys for OTRv4 to his client, Bob's client must
publish 3 prekey messages.

Details on how to interact with a prekey server to publish messages are outside
the scope of this protocol.

#### Validating Prekey Messages

Use the following checks to validate a Prekey message. If any of the checks
fail, ignore the message:

  1. Check that the User Profile is not expired.
  2. Check that the Prekey Profile is not expired.
  3. Check that the OTR version of the prekey message matches one of the
     versions signed in the User Profile contained in the prekey message.
  4. Check if the User Profile's version is supported by the receiver.

Note that these steps can be done in anticipation of sending a
Non-Interactive-Auth message.

#### Receiving Prekey Messages

Details on how prekey messages may be received from a prekey server are outside
the scope of this protocol. This specification assumes that none, one, or more
than one prekey messages may arrive. If the prekey server cannot return any
prekey messages, the non-interactive DAKE must wait until one can be obtained.

The following guide is meant to help implementers identify and remove invalid
prekey messages.

If one Prekey message is received:

1. [Validate the Prekey message](#validating-prekey-messages).
2. If the Prekey message is valid, decide whether to send a
   Non-Interactive-Auth message depending on whether the long term key in the
   use profile is trusted or not.

If many prekey messages are received:

1. [Validate the Prekey messages](#validating-prekey-messages).
2. Discard all invalid prekey messages.
3. Discard all duplicate prekey messages in the list.
4. If one Prekey message remains:
    * Decide whether to send a message using this Prekey message if the long
      term key within the use profile is trusted or not.
5. If multiple valid prekey messages remain:
    * If there are keys that are untrusted and trusted in the list of messages,
      decide whether to only use messages that contain trusted long term keys.
    * If there are several instance tags in the list of prekey messages,
      decide which instance tags to send messages to.
    * If there are multiple prekey messages per instance tag, decide whether
      to send multiple messages to the same instance tag.

### Encrypted Messages in DAKE's Messages

One message of XZDH allows participants to attach an encrypted message to it.
This message will be referred as "attached encrypted message".

Note that if a data message arrives prior to the Auth-I or the
Non-Interactive-Auth message, this data message will be ignored. An attached
encrypted message to the Non-Interactive-Auth message cannot contain any TLV
types.

#### Attaching an Encrypted Message to Non-Interactive-Auth Message in XZDH

##### Encrypting the Message

After deriving the Mixed shared secret `K`, a participant (Alice in the above
overview) can attach an encrypted message to the already generated
Non-Interactive-Auth message, but prior to sending it. For this, the
participant:

* Rotates the ECDH keys and brace key, see
  [Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as sender](#rotating-ecdh-keys-and-brace-key-as-sender)
  section. The derived ECDH public key will be the 'Public ECDH Key' for the
  message. The derived DH public key will be the 'Public DH Key' for the
  message.
* Calculates the shared secret `K = KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
* Derive new set of keys:
  `root_key[i], chain_key_s[i][j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending,
  root_key[i-1], K)`.
  Securely deletes the previous root key (`root_key[i-1]`) and `K`.
* Sets `i` as the attached message ratchet id.
* Increments the ratchet id `i = i + 1`.
* Sets `j` as the attached message id.
* Derives the next sending chain key by using the `chain_key_s[i-1][j]` already
  derived:

  ```
    chain_key_s[i-1][j+1] = KDF_1(0x23 || chain_key_s[i-1][j], 64)
  ```

* Calculates the encryption key (`MKenc`):

  ```
    MKenc = KDF_1(0x24 || chain_key_s[i-1][j], 32)
  ```

* Securely deletes `chain_key_s[i-1][j]`.
* Increments the next sending message id `j = j + 1`.
* Constructs a nonce from the first 24 bytes of the `c` variable generated when
  creating `sigma`. See
  [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication) section
  for details.
* Uses the `MKenc` to encrypt the message:
  `encrypted_message = XSalsa20_Enc(MKenc, nonce, m)`.
* Securely deletes `MKenc`.

The format of this attached message in the Non-Interactive-Auth message will be:

```
Attached XZDH Encrypted Message (XZDH-ENCRYPTED-MSG)

Attached Encrypted Ratchet Id (INT)
  Set with sender's i.

Attached Encrypted Message Id (INT)
  Set with sender's j.

Public ECDH Key (POINT)
  This is the public part of the ECDH key pair. For the sender of this message,
  this is their 'our_ecdh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is
  used as 'their_ecdh'.

Public DH Key (MPI)
  This is the public part of the DH key pair. For the sender of this message, it
  is 'our_dh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is used as
  'their_dh'.

Encrypted message (DATA)
  Using the appropriate encryption/message key, perform an XSalsa20 encryption
  of the message. The 'nonce' used for this operation is also included in
  the header of the attached message packet.
```

After the encryption and MAC of the attached encrypted message, the participant
attaches it to the Non-Interactive-Auth message, which will look like this:

```
  (Protocol version || message type || sender's instance tag || receiver's
   instance tag || Sender's User Profile || X || A || sigma || Auth MAC ||
  (attached message ratchet id || attached message id || public ECDH key ||
   public DH key || encrypted message))
```

##### Decrypting the Message

After verifying `sigma` on the Non-Interactive-Auth message, a participant (Bob
in the above overview) can decrypt an attached encrypted message if it was
attached. This has to be done prior to receiving any other data message, or
sending one. For this, the participant:

* Rotates the ECDH keys and brace key, see
  [Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as receiver](#rotating-ecdh-keys-and-brace-key-as-receiver)
  section.
* Calculates `K = KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
* Derive new set of keys
  `root_key[i], chain_key_r[i][k] = derive_ratchet_keys(receiving, root_key[i-1], K)`.
* Securely delete the previous root key (`root_key[i-1]`) and `K`.
* Increments the ratchet id `i = i + 1`.
* Derives the next receiving chain key by using the `chain_key_r[i-1][k]`
  already derived and decided:

  ```
    chain_key_r[i-1][k+1] = KDF_1(0x23 || chain_key_r[i-1][k], 64)
  ```

* Calculates the encryption key (`MKenc`):
  `MKenc = KDF_1(0x24 || chain_key_r[i-1][k], 32)`
* Securely deletes `chain_key_r[i-1][k]`.
* Uses `auth_mac_k` to generate the `Auth MAC` of the attached
  encrypted message (the `t` value here is the one computed during the
  verification of the Non-Interactive-Auth message):
  `Auth MAC = KDF_1(0x18 || auth_mac_k || t || (KDF_1(0x17 || attached encrypted
   ratchet id || attached encrypted message id || public ECDH key || public DH
   key || nonce || encrypted message, 64)), 64)`.
* Extracts the `Auth MAC` from the Non-Interactive-Auth message and verifies
  that it is equal to the one just calculated. If it is not, ignores
  the Non-Interactive-Auth message and rejects the attached encrypted message.
* Increments the next receiving message id `k = k + 1`.
* Constructs the nonce from the first 24 bytes of the `c` variable generated
  when creating `sigma`. See
  [Ring Signature Verification](#verification-rvrfa1-a2-a3-sigma-m) section for
  details.
* Uses the `MKenc` and `nonce` to decrypt the message:
  `decrypted_message = XSalsa20_Dec(MKenc, nonce, m)`.
* Securely deletes `MKenc`.
* Adds `auth_mac_k` to the list `mac_keys_to_reveal`.

## Data Exchange

This section describes how each participant will use the Double Ratchet
algorithm to exchange [Data Messages](#data-message). The Double Ratchet
algorithm is initialized with the shared secret established in the DAKE and the
public keys immediately exchanged. Detailed validation and processing of each
data message is described in the
[sending a Data Message](#sending-a-data-message)
and [receiving a Data Messages](#receiving-a-data-message) sections.

A message with an empty human-readable part (the plaintext is of zero length, or
starts with a `NULL`) is a "heartbeat" message. This message is useful for key
rotations and revealing MAC keys. It should not be displayed to the participant.
If you have not sent a message to a correspondent in some (configurable) time,
send a "heartbeat" message, consisting of a Data Message encoding and an empty
plaintext. The heartbeat message should have the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.

### Data Message

This message is used to transmit a private message to the correspondent. It is
also used to [Reveal Old MAC Keys](#revealing-mac-keys). This data message is
encoded as defined in the [Encoded Messages](#encoded-messages) section.

The plaintext message (either before encryption or after decryption) consists of
a human-readable message (encoded in UTF-8, optionally with HTML markup),
optionally followed by:

* a single `NUL` (a BYTE with value 0x00)
* zero or more TLV (type/length/value) records (with no padding between them)

#### Data Message Format

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The Data Message has type 0x03.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient.

Flags (BYTE)
  The bitwise-OR of the flags for this message. Usually you should set this to
  0x00. The only currently defined flag is:

  IGNORE_UNREADABLE (0x01)

    If you receive a Data Message with this flag set, and you are unable to
    decrypt the message or verify the MAC (because, for example, you don't have
    the right keys), just ignore the message instead of producing an error or a
    notification to the participant.

Previous chain message number (INT)
  This should be set with sender's pn.

Ratchet id (INT)
  This should be set with sender's i.

Message id (INT)
  This should be set with sender's j.

Public ECDH Key (POINT)
  This is the public part of the ECDH key pair. For the sender of this message,
  this is their 'our_ecdh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is
  used as 'their_ecdh'.

Public DH Key (MPI)
  This is the public part of the DH key pair. For the sender of this message, it
  is 'our_dh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is used as
  'their_dh'. If this value is empty, its length is zero.

Nonce (NONCE)
  The nonce used with XSalsa20 to create the encrypted message contained in this
  packet.

Encrypted message (DATA)
  Using the appropriate encryption key (see below) derived from the sender's
  and recipient's ECDH and DH public keys (with the keyids given in this
  message), perform an XSalsa20 encryption of the message. The 'nonce' used for
  this operation is also included in the header of the data message packet.

Authenticator (MAC)
  The MAC with the appropriate MAC key (see below) of everything: from the
  protocol version to the end of the encrypted message. Note that old MAC keys
  are not included in this field.

Old MAC keys to be revealed (DATA)
  See "Revealing MAC Keys" section. This corresponds to the 'mac_keys_to_reveal'
  variable.
```

#### When you send a Data Message:

In order to send an encoded data message, a key is required to encrypt the
message in it. This per-message key (`MKenc`) is the output key from the sending
and receiving KDF chains. As defined in [\[2\]](#references), the KDF keys for
these chains are called 'chain keys'. When a participant wants to send a data
message after receiving another one, ratchet keys should be rotated (the ECDH
keys, the brace key, the root key and the sending chain key) and the `j`
parameter should be set to 0.

Given a new DH Ratchet:

  * Rotate the ECDH keys and brace key, see
    [Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as sender](#rotating-ecdh-keys-and-brace-key-as-sender)
    section.
    The new ECDH public key created by the sender in this process will be the
    'Public ECDH Key' for the message. If a new public DH key is created in
    this process, it will be the 'Public DH Key' for the message. If it is
    not created (meaning it is only a KDF of the previous one), then it will be
    empty.
  * Calculate the shared secret `K = KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
  * Derive new set of keys:
    `root_key[i], chain_key_s[i][j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending, root_key[i-1], K)`.
  * Securely delete the previous root key (`root_key[i-1]`) and `K`.
  * Set `i` as the Data message's ratchet id.
  * Increment the ratchet id `i = i + 1`.
  * If present, forget and reveal MAC keys. The conditions for revealing MAC
    keys are stated in the [Revealing MAC Keys](#revealing-mac-keys) section.
  * Derive the next sending chain key, `MKenc` and `MKmac`, and encrypt the
    message as described below.

When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:

  * Set `j` as the Data message's message id.
  * Set `i - 1` as the Data message's ratchet id.
  * Derive the next sending chain key
    `chain_key_s[i-1][j+1] = KDF_1(0x23 || chain_key_s[i-1][j], 64)`.
  * Calculate the encryption key (`MKenc`), the MAC key (`MKmac`) and, if needed
    the extra symmetric key:

   ```
     MKenc, MKmac = derive_enc_mac_keys(chain_key_s[i-1][j])
     extra_symm_key = KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key_s[i-1][j], 32)
   ```

  * Securely delete `chain_key_s[i-1][j]`.
  * Increment the next sending message id `j = j + 1`.
  * Generate a new random 24 bytes value to be the `nonce`.
  * Use the `MKenc` to encrypt the message:

   ```
     encrypted_message = XSalsa20_Enc(MKenc, nonce, m)
   ```

  * Use the `MKmac` to create a MAC tag. MAC all the sections of the data
    message from the protocol version to the encrypted message.

   ```
     Authenticator = KDF_1(0x28 || MKmac || KDF_1(0x27 || data_message_sections, 64), 64)
   ```

  * Securely delete `MKenc` and `MKmac`.
  * Continue to use the sender's instance tag.

#### When you receive a Data Message:

The counterpart of the sending an encoded data message. As that one, it also
needs a per-message key derived from the previous chain key to decrypt the
message in it. If the receiving `j` is equal to 0, and the receiving 'Public
ECDH Key' has not yet been seen, ratchet keys should be rotated (the ECDH keys,
the brace key, the root key and the receiving chain key).

Decrypting a data message consists of:

1. If the encrypted message corresponds to an stored message key corresponding
   to an skipped message, the message is verified and decrypted with that key
   which is deleted from the storage.
2. If a new ratchet key has been received, any message keys corresponding to
   skipped messages from the previous receiving ratchet are stored. A new DH
   ratchet is performed.
3. If a new message from the current receiving ratchet is received, any message
   keys corresponding to skipped messages from the same ratchet are stored, and
   a symmetric-key ratchet is performed to derive the current message key and
   the next receiving chain key. The message is then verified and decrypted.

This is done by:

* Check that the receiver's instance tag matches your sender's instance tag.
  * If they do not match, discard the message.

* Try to decrypt the message with a stored skipped message key:

  * If the received `j` and `i` are in the `skipped_MKenc` dictionary:
    * Compare the received 'Public ECDH Key' and, if present, the
      received 'Public DH Key' with the stored ones.
      * If they are equal:
          * Get the message key and the extra symmetric key (if needed):
            `MKenc, extra_symm_key = skipped_MKenc[Public ECDH Key,
            Public DH Key, i, j]`.
          * Securely delete
            `skipped_MKenc[Public ECDH Key, Public DH Key, i, j]`.
          * Calculate `MKmac = KDF_1(0x25 || MKenc, 64)`.
          * Use the `MKmac` to verify the MAC of the data message.
          * Set `nonce` as the "nonce" from the received data message.
          * Decrypt the message using `MKenc` and `nonce`:

            ```
              decrypted_message = XSalsa20_Dec(MKenc, nonce, m)
            ```

          * Securely delete `MKenc` and `nonce`.
          * Add `MKmac` to the list `mac_keys_to_reveal`.

* Given a new ratchet (the received `j` is equal to 0, the 'Public ECDH Key' is
  different from `their_ecdh` and the 'Public DH Key' is different from
  `their_dh` -if present-):

  * Store any message keys from the previous DH Ratchet that correspond to
    messages that have not yet arrived:
      * If `k` + `max_skip` < received `pn`:
         * Raise an exception that informs the participant that too many message
           keys are stored.
      * If `chain_key_r` is not `NULL`:
         * while `k` < received `pn`:
             * Derive
               `chain_key_r[i][k+1] = KDF_1(0x23 || chain_key_r[i][k], 64)`
               and `MKenc = KDF_1(0x24 || chain_key_r[i][k], 32)`
             * Derive (this is done any time a message key is stored as
               there is no way of knowing if the message that will be received
               in the future will ask for the computation of the extra
               symmetric key):
               `extra_symm_key = KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key_r[i][j], 32)`.
             * Store
               `MKenc, extra_sym_key = skipped_MKenc[Public ECDH Key, Public DH Key, i, k]`.
             * Increment `k = k + 1`.
             * Delete `chain_key_r[i][k]`.
  * Rotate the ECDH keys and brace key, see
    [Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as receiver](#rotating-ecdh-keys-and-brace-key-as-receiver)
    section.
  * Set the received `pn` as `j`.
  * Calculate `K = KDF_1(0x04 || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
  * Derive new set of keys
    `root_key[i], chain_key_r[i][k] = derive_ratchet_keys(receiving, root_key[i-1], K)`.

* When receiving a data message in the same DH Ratchet:
  * Store any message keys from the current DH Ratchet that correspond to
    messages that have not yet arrived:
    * If `k` + `max_skip` < received `j`:
         * Raise an exception that informs the participant that too many message
           keys are stored.
      * If `chain_key_r` is not `NULL`:
         * while `k` < received `j`:
             * Derive
               `chain_key_r[i][k+1] = KDF_1(0x23 || chain_key_r[i][k], 64)`
               and `MKenc = KDF_1(0x24 || chain_key_r[i][k], 32)`
             * Derive (this is done any time a message key is stored as
               there is no way of knowing if the message that will be received
               in the future will ask for the computation of the extra
               symmetric key):
               `extra_symm_key = KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key_r[i-1][j], 32)`.
             * Store

             * Delete `chain_key_r[i-1][k]`.
  * Calculate the encryption and MAC keys (`MKenc` and `MKmac`).

    ```
      MKenc, MKmac = derive_enc_mac_keys(chain_key_r[i-1][k])
      extra_symm_key = KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key_r[i-1][k], 32)

  * Derive the next receiving chain key:

  * Securely delete `chain_key_r[i-1][k]`.
  * Use the `MKmac` to verify the MAC of the message. If the verification fails:
      * Reject the message.
  * Otherwise:
      * Increment the next receiving message id `k = k + 1`.
      * Set `nonce` as the "nonce" from the received data message.
      * Decrypt the message using `MKenc` and `nonce`:

      ```
        decrypted_message = XSalsa20_Dec(MKenc, nonce, m)
      ```

      * If the message cannot be decrypted:
        * Reject the message.

      * Securely delete `MKenc` and `nonce`.
      * Set `their_ecdh` as the 'Public ECDH key' from the message.
      * Set `their_dh` as the 'Public DH Key' from the message, if it is not
        empty.
      * Add `MKmac` to the list `mac_keys_to_reveal`.

* If a message arrives that corresponds to a message key already deleted or that
  cannot be derived:
  * Reject the message.

### Deletion of Stored Message Keys

Storing message keys from messages that haven't arrived yet introduces some
risks, as defined in [\[2\]](#references):

1. A malicious sender could induce receivers to store large numbers of skipped
   message keys, possibly causing a denial-of-service due to consuming storage
   space.
2. An adversary can capture and drop some messages from sender, even though they
   didn't reach the recipient. The attacker can later compromise the intended
   recipient at a later time to reveal the stored message keys that correspond
   to the dropped messages. The adversary can then retroactively decrypt the
   captured messages.

To mitigate the first risk, parties should set reasonable per-conversation
limits on the number of possible stored message keys (e.g. 1000). This limit
is set by the implementers.

To mitigate the second risk, parties should delete stored message keys after an
appropriate interval. This deletion could be triggered by a timer, or by
counting the number of events (messages received, DH ratchet steps, etc.). This
should be decided by the implementer. This partially defends against the second
risk as it only protects "lost" messages, not messages sent using a new
DH ratchet key that has not yet been received by the compromised party.
To also defend against the second risk, the session should be regularly expired,
as defined in the [Session Expiration](#session-expiration) section.

### Extra Symmetric Key

Like OTRv3, OTRv4 defines an additional symmetric key that can be derived by
the communicating parties for use of application-specific purposes, such as
file transfer, voice encryption, etc. When one party wishes to use the extra
symmetric key, they create a type 7 TLV, which they attach to a Data Message.
The extra symmetric key itself is then derived using the same `chain_key` used
to compute the message encryption key used to protect the Data Message. It is,
therefore, derived by calculating `KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key)`.

Upon receipt of the Data Message containing the type 7 TLV, the recipient will
compute the extra symmetric key in the same way. Note that the value of the
extra symmetric key is not contained in the TLV itself.

If more keys are wished to be derived from this already calculated extra
symmetric key, this can be done by taking the index from the TLV list received
in the data message and the context received in 7 TLV (the 4-byte indication
of what this symmetric key will be used for), and use them as inputs to a KDF:

```
  symkey1 = KDF_1(index || context || extra_sym_key, 32)
```

So, if for example, these TLVs arrive with the data message:

```
  TLV 1
  TLV 7   context: 0x0042
  TLV 2
  TLV 7   context: 0x104A
  TLV 3
  TLV 7   context: 0x0001
```

Three keys can, therefore, be calculated from the already derived extra
symmetric key:

```
  extra_sym_key = KDF_1(0x26 || 0xFF || chain_key, 32)
  symkey1 = KDF_1(0x00 || 0x0042 || extra_sym_key, 32)
  symkey2 = KDF_1(0x01 || 0x104A || extra_sym_key, 32)
  symkey3 = KDF_1(0x02 || 0x0001 || extra_sym_key, 32)
```

Every derived key and the `extra_symm_key` should be deleted after being used.

### Revealing MAC Keys

Old MAC keys are keys from already received messages, that will no longer be
used to verify the authenticity of that message. We reveal them in order to
provide [Forgeability of Messages](#forging-transcripts): once MAC keys are
revealed, anyone can modify an OTR message and still have it appear as valid.

A MAC key is added to `mac_keys_to_reveal` list after a participant has verified
the message associated with that MAC key. They are also added if the session is
expired or when the storage of message keys gets deleted, and the MAC keys for
messages that have not arrived are derived.

Old MAC keys are formatted as a list of 64-byte concatenated values. The first
data message sent every ratchet reveals them or the TLV type 7 that is used then
the session is expired.

## Fragmentation

Some networks may have a _maximum message size_ that is too small to contain
an encoded OTR message. In that event, the sender may choose to split the
message into a number of fragments. This section describes the format for the
fragments.

OTRv4 fragmentation and reassembly procedure needs to be able to break
data messages into an almost arbitrary number of pieces that can be later
reassembled.  The receiver of the fragments uses the identifier field to ensure
that fragments of different data messages are not mixed. The fragment index
field tells the receiver the position of a fragment in the original data
message. These fields provide sufficient information to reassemble data
messages.

OTRv4 and OTRv3 perform fragmentation in different ways. As OTRv4 supports an
out-of-order network model, fragmentation is different. Nevertheless, for
both OTR versions, message parsing should happen after the message has been
defragmented.

All OTRv4 clients must be able to reassemble received fragments, but performing
fragmentation on outgoing messages is optional.

For fragmentation in OTRv3, refer to the "Fragmentation" section on OTRv3
specification.

### Transmitting Fragments

If you have information about the _maximum message size_ you are able to send
(different IM networks have different limits), you can fragment an encoded
OTR message as follows:

  * Start with the OTR message as you would normally transmit it. For example,
    a Data Message would start with
    `?OTR:AAQD` and end with `.`.
  * Assign an identifier, which will be used specifically for this fragmented
    data message. This is done in order to not confuse these fragments with
    other data message's fragments. The identifier is a unique randomly
    generated 8-byte value that must be unique for the time the data message
    is fragmented.
  * Break it up into sufficiently small pieces. Let this number of pieces be
    `total`, and the pieces be `piece[1],piece[2],...,piece[total]`.
  * Transmit `total` OTRv4 fragmented messages with the following (printf-like)
    structure (as `index` runs from 1 to `total` inclusive:

  ```
  "?OTR|%x|%x|%x,%hu,%hu,%s,", identifier, sender_instance, receiver_instance, index, total, piece[index]
  ```

  OTRv3 messages get fragmented in a similar format, but without the identifier
  field:

  ```
  "?OTR|%x|%x,%hu,%hu,%s,", sender_instance, receiver_instance, index, total, piece[index]
  ```

The message should begin with `?OTR|` and end with `,`.

Note that `index` and `total` are unsigned short int (2 bytes), and each has a
maximum value of 65535. Each `piece[index]` must be non-empty. The `identifier`,
instance tags, `index` and `total` values may have leading zeros.

Note that fragments are not messages that can be fragmented: you can't fragment
a fragment.

### Receiving Fragments

If you receive a message containing `?OTR|` (note that you'll need to check
for this _before_ checking for any of the other `?OTR:` markers):

  * Parse it (as the previous printf structure) extracting the `identifier`,
    the instance tags, `index`, `total`, and `piece[index]`.

  * Discard the message and optionally pass a warning to the participant if:
    * The recipient's own instance tag does not match the listed receiver
      instance tag.
    * The listed receiver's instance tag is not zero.

  * Discard the (illegal) fragment if:
    * `index` is 0
    * `total` is 0
    * `index` is bigger than `total`

  * For the first fragment that arrives (there is not a current buffer with the
    same `identifier`):
    * Create a buffer which will keep track of the portions of the fragmented
      data message that have arrived (by filling up it with fragments).
    * Optionally, initialize a timer for the reassembly of the fragments as it
      is possible that some fragments of the data message might never show up.
      This timer ensures that a client will not be "forever" waiting for a
      fragment. If the timer runs out, all stored fragments in this buffer
      should be discarded.
    * Let `B` be the buffer, `I` be the currently stored identifier, `T` the
      currently stored `total` and `C` a counter that keeps track of the
      received number of fragments for this buffer. If you have no currently
      stored fragments, there are no buffers, and `I`, `T` and `C` equal 0.
    * Set the length of the buffer as `total`: `len(B) = total`.
    * Store `piece` at the `index` given position: `insert(piece, index)`.
    * Let `total` be `T` and `identifier` be `I` for the buffer.
    * Increment the buffer counter: `C = C + 1`.

  * If `identifier == I`:
    * If `total == T`, and `C < T`:
      * Check that the given position of the buffer is empty:
        `B[index] == NULL`. If it is not, reject the fragment.
      * Store the `piece` at the given position in the buffer:
        `insert(piece, index)`.
      * Increment the buffer counter: `C = C + 1`.
    * Otherwise:
      * Forget any stored fragments of this buffer you may have.
      * Reset `C`, `N` and `I` to 0, and discard this buffer.

  * Otherwise:
    * Consider this fragment as part of another buffer: either create a new
      buffer or insert the fragment into one that has already been created.

After this, if the current buffer's `C == T`, treat the buffer as the received
data message.

If you receive a non-OTR message or an unfragmented message:

* Keep track of the buffers you may already have. Do not discard them.

For example, here is a Data Message we would like to transmit over a network
with an unreasonably small `maximum message size`:

    ?OTR:AAMDJ+MVmSfjFZcAAAAAAQAAAAIAAADA1g5IjD1ZGLDVQEyCgCyn9hb
    rL3KAbGDdzE2ZkMyTKl7XfkSxh8YJnudstiB74i4BzT0W2haClg6dMary/jo

    AAAEAAAAHwNiIi5Ms+4PsY/L2ipkTtquknfx6HodLvk3RAAAAAA==.

We could fragment this message into three pieces:

    ?OTR|5a73a599|27e31597,00001,00003,?OTR:AAMDJ+MVmSfjFZcAAAAA
    AQAAAAIAAADA1g5IjD1ZGLDVQEyCgCyn9hbrL3KAbGDdzE2ZkMyTKl7XfkSx

## The Protocol State Machine

An OTR client maintains separate state for every correspondent. For example,
Alice may have an active OTR conversation with Bob, while having an insecure
conversation with Charlie.

The way the client reacts to user input and to received messages depends on
whether the client has decided to allow version 3 and/or 4, if encryption is
required and if it will advertise OTR support.

### Protocol States

```
START

  This is the initial state before an OTR conversation starts. The only way to
  enter this state is for the participant to explicitly request it via some UI
  operation. Messages sent in this state are plaintext messages. If a TLV type 1
  (Disconnected) message is sent in any of the other states, transition to this
  state. Note that this transition only happens when TLV type 1 message is sent,
  not when it is received.

WAITING_AUTH_R

  This is the state used when a participant is waiting for an Auth-R message.
  This state is entered after an Identity message is sent.

WAITING_AUTH_I

  This is the state used when a participant is waiting for an Auth-I message.
  This state is entered after sending an Auth-R message.

ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES

  This state is entered after the DAKE is finished. The interactive DAKE is
  finished after the Auth-I message is sent, received and validated. The
  non-interactive DAKE is finished when the Non-Interactive-Auth message is
  sent, and when it is received and validated. Outgoing messages sent in this
  state are encrypted.

FINISHED

  This state is entered only when a participant receives a TLV type 1
  (Disconnected) message, which indicates they have terminated their side
  of the OTR conversation. For example, if Alice and Bob are having an OTR
  conversation, and Bob instructs his OTR client to end its private session
  with Alice (for example, by logging out), Alice will be notified of this,
  and her client will switch to the FINISHED state. This prevents Alice from
  accidentally sending a message to Bob in plaintext (consider what happens
  if Alice was in the middle of typing a private message to Bob when he
  suddenly logs out, just as Alice hits the 'enter' key). Note that this
  transition only happens when TLV type 1 message is received, not when it is
  sent. This state indicates that outgoing messages are not delivered at all.
```

### Protocol Events

The following sections outline the actions that the protocol should implement.
This assumes that the client is initialized with the allowed versions
(3 and/or 4).

There are fourteen events an OTRv4 client must handle (for version 3 messages,
please refer to previous OTR protocol document):

* Received messages:
  * Plaintext without the whitespace tag
  * Plaintext with the whitespace tag
  * Query Messages
  * Error Message
  * Identity Message
  * Auth-R Message
  * Auth-I Message
  * Prekey Message
  * Non-Interactive-Auth Message
  * Data Message

* User actions:
  * User requests to start an OTR conversation
  * Starting a conversation interactively
  * User requests to end an OTR conversation
  * Sending an encrypted data message

For version 4 messages, someone receiving a message with a recipient instance
tag specified that does not equal their own, should discard the message and
optionally warn the user. The exception here is the Identity Message where the
receiver's instance tag may be 0, indicating that no particular instance is
specified, and the Prekey Message that does not include this field.

#### User requests to start an OTR Conversation

Send an OTR Query Message or a plaintext message with a whitespace
tag to the correspondent. [Query Messages](#query-messages) and [Whitespace
Tags](#whitespace-tags) are constructed according to the sections below.

##### Query Messages

If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she would like to use OTR, she sends
a message containing the string "?OTRv" followed by an indication of what
versions of OTR she is willing to use with Bob. The versions she is willing to
use, whether she can set this on a global level or per-correspondent basis, is
up to the implementer. However, enabling users to choose whether they want to
allow or disallow a version is required, as OTR clients can set different
policies for different correspondents. For example, Alice could set up her
client so that it speaks only OTR version 4, except with Charlie, who she knows
has only an old client; so that it will opportunistically start an OTR
conversation whenever it detects the correspondent supports it; or so that it
refuses to send non-encrypted messages to Bob, ever.

Query Messages are not allowed to be sent in `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.

The version string is constructed as follows:

If Alice is willing to use OTR, she appends a byte identifier for the versions
in question, followed by "?". The byte identifier for OTR version 3 is "3", and
"4" for 4. Thus, if she is willing to use OTR versions 3 and 4, the identifier
would be "34". The order of the identifiers between the "v" and the "?" does not
matter, but none should be listed more than once. The OTRv4 specification only
supports versions 3 and higher. Thus, query messages for older versions have
been omitted.

Example query messages:

```
"?OTRv3?"
    Version 3
"?OTRv45x?"
    Version 4, and hypothetical future versions identified by "5" and "x"
"?OTRv?"
    A bizarre claim that Alice would like to start an OTR conversation, but is
    unwilling to speak any version of the protocol. Although this is
    syntactically valid, the receiver will not reply when receiving this.
```

These strings may be hidden from the user (for example, in an attribute of an
HTML tag), and may be accompanied by an explanatory message ("Alice has
requested an Off-the-Record private conversation."). If Bob is willing to use
OTR with Alice (with a protocol version that Alice has offered), he should start
the AKE or DAKE according to the compatible version he supports.

##### Whitespace Tags

If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she is willing to use OTR, she can
attach a special whitespace tag to any plaintext message she sends him. A
Whitespace tag may occur anywhere in the message, and may be hidden from the
user (as in the [Query Messages](#query-messages)). There should be only one
whitespace tag per message. In the case that multiple whitespace tags arrive,
only the first one should be considered as valid.

The tag consists of the following 16 bytes, followed by one or more sets of
8 bytes indicating the version of OTR Alice is willing to use:

```
  Always send "\x20\x09\x20\x20\x09\x09\x09\x09"
  "\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20",
  followed by one or more of:
    "\x20\x20\x09\x09\x20\x20\x09\x09"
  to indicate a willingness to use OTR version 3 with Bob or
    "\x20\x20\x09\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20"
  to indicate a willingness to use OTR version 4 with Bob
```

If Bob is willing to use OTR with Alice, with the protocol version that Alice
has offered, he should start the AKE or DAKE. On the other hand, if Alice
receives a plaintext message from Bob (rather than an initiation of the AKE or
DAKE), she should stop sending him a whitespace tag.

#### Receiving plaintext without the whitespace tag

Display the message to the user.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` or `FINISHED`:

  * The user should be warned that the message received was unencrypted.

For OTRv3, if msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:

  * Display the message to the user. The user should be warned that the message
    received was unencrypted.

#### Receiving plaintext with the whitespace tag

Remove the whitespace tag and display the message to the user.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` or `FINISHED`:

  * The user should be warned that the message received was unencrypted.

For OTRv3, if msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:

  * Display the message to the user. The user should be warned that the message
    received was unencrypted.

If the client has some policy dictating that 'OTR is always required' or that
'encryption is always required' (like `REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION` in OTRv3), and the
tag offers OTR version 4 and version 4 is allowed:

  * Queue the message for encrypting and sending it when the participant
    transitions to the `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.
  * Send an Identity message.
  * Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

In any event:

  * If the tag offers OTR version 4 and version 4 is allowed:
    * Send an Identity message.
    * Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

  * If the tag offers OTR version 3 and version 3 is allowed:
    * Send a version `3 D-H Commit Message`.
    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`.

#### Receiving a Query Message

If the Query Message offers OTR version 4 and version 4 is allowed:

  * Send an Identity message.
  * Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

If the Query message offers OTR version 3 and version 3 is allowed:

  * Send a version `3 D-H Commit Message`.
  * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`.

#### Starting a conversation interactively

Rather than requesting an encrypted conversation, Alice can directly start an
OTRv4 conversation with Bob if she is certain that they both support it and are
willing to do so. In such case, Alice should:

* Send an Identity message.
* Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

#### Receiving an Identity Message

If the state is `START`:

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Remember the sender's instance tag to use as the receiver's instance tag
      for future messages.
    * Reply with an Auth-R message.
    * Transition to the `WAITING_AUTH_R` state.

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  ```
    You and the other participant have sent Identity messages to each other.
    This can happen if they send you an Identity message before receiving
    yours. Only one Identity message must be chosen for use.
  ```

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Compare the hashed `B` you sent in your Identity message with the DH value
      from the message you received, considered as 32-byte unsigned big-endian
      values.
    * If yours is the higher hash value:
      * Ignore the incoming Identity message, but resend your Identity message.
        This means that the other side have the lower hash value and, therefore,
        will keep going as stated below.
    * Otherwise:
      * Forget your old `B` value that you sent earlier.
      * Pretend you are on `START` state.
      * Send an Auth-R message.
      * Transition state to `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_I`:

  ```
    There are a number of reasons that you may receive an Identity Message in
    this state. Perhaps your correspondent simply started a new DAKE or they
    resent their Identity Message. On some networks, like AIM, if your
    correspondent is logged in multiple times, each of his clients will send an
    Identity Message in response to a Query Message. Resending the same Auth-R
    Message in response to each of those messages will prevent compounded
    confusion, since each of their clients will see each of the Auth-R Messages
    you send.
  ```

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Forget the old `their_ecdh` and `their_dh` from the previously received
      Identity message.
    * Send a new Auth-R message with the new values received.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`:

   * If this Auth-R message is the same the one you received earlier (when you
     send an Auth-I message):
     * Retransmit your Auth-I Message.
   * Otherwise:
     * Ignore the message.

#### Sending an Auth-R Message

* Generate and send an Auth-R Message.
* Transition to state `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

#### Receiving an Auth-R Message

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using, ignore the message.
  * Validate the Auth-R message.
    * If validation fails:
      * Ignore the message.
      * Stay in state `WAITING_AUTH_R`.
    * If validation succeeds:
      * Reply with an Auth-I message, as defined in
        [Sending an Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message) section.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`:

   * If this Auth-R message is the same the one you received earlier (when you
     send an Auth-I message):
     * Retransmit your Auth-I Message.

If the state is not `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  * Ignore this message.

#### Sending an Auth-I Message

* Generate and send an Auth-I message.
* Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
  [Interactive DAKE Overview](#interactive-dake-overview) section.
* Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.

#### Receiving an Auth-I Message

* If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_I`:
  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using, ignore this message.
  * Validate the Auth-I message.
    * If validation fails
      * Ignore the message.
      * Stay in state `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

    * If validation succeeds:
      * Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.
      * Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
        [Interactive DAKE Overview](#interactive-dake-overview) section.

* If the state is not `WAITING_AUTH_I`:
  * Ignore this message.

#### Sending a Data Message to an offline participant

* Generate and send a Non-Interactive-Auth message.
* Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
  [Non-Interactive DAKE Overview](#non-interactive-dake-overview) section.
* Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.
* If there is a recent stored message, encrypt it and send it as a Data Message.

#### Receiving a Non-Interactive-Auth Message

* If the state is `FINISHED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:
  * Ignore the message.

* Else:
  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using:
    * Ignore this message.

  * Otherwise:
    * Validate the Non-Interactive-Auth message.
    * Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
      [Non-Interactive DAKE Overview](#non-interactive-dake-overview) section.
    * Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.

#### Sending a Data Message

The `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state is the state where a participant is allowed to
send encrypted data messages. There are only one other state in which a
participant can send an attached encrypted message (that do not have the same
format as a data message):

* On `START`: when a participant attaches an encrypted message to the
  Non-Interactive-Auth message.

In any other case and if the state is `START`, `WAITING_AUTH_R`, or
`WAITING_AUTH_I`, queue the message for encrypting and sending it when the
participant transitions to the `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.

If the state is `FINISHED`, the participant must start another OTR conversation
to send encrypted messages:

  * Inform the user that the message cannot be sent at this time.
  * Store the plaintext message for possible retransmission.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED`, encrypt the message, and send it as a Data Message.
Store plaintext message for possible retransmission.

#### Receiving a Data Message

A received data message will look like this:

```
  ["?OTR" || protocol version || message type || sender's instance_tag ||receiver's instance tag ||
    flags || previous chain message number || ratchet id || message id || public ECDH key ||
    public DH key || nonce || enc(plaintext message || TLV) || authenticator ||
    old MAC keys to be revealed ]
```

If the version is 4:

* If the state is not `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`:
  * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received by
    replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_2`.
  * There are only one other state in which a participant can receive an
    encrypted message (that do not have the same format as a data message):
      * On `START`: when the other participant sends you an
        Non-Interactive-Auth message that has an attached encrypted message in
        it.

* Otherwise:
  * Validate the data message:
     * Verify the MAC tag.
     * Check if the message version is allowed.
     * Check that the instance tag in the message is the instance tag you are
       currently using.
     * Verify that the public ECDH key is on curve Ed448. See
       [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
       section for details.
     * Verify that the public DH key is from the correct group. See
       [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
       section for details.

    * If the message is not valid in any of the above steps:
      * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received by
        replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_2`.

    * Otherwise:
      * Derive the corresponding decryption key depending if you are on a new
        DH ratchet, if you have stored keys or not. Try to decrypt the message.
      * If the message cannot be decrypted (e.g., this is a duplicated message
        which key has already been used) and the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag is
        not set:
          * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received
            by replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_1`.

      * If the message cannot be decrypted and the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag is
        set:
          * Ignore it instead of producing an error or a notification to the
            user.

      * If the message can be decrypted:
          * Display the human-readable part (if non empty) to the user.
            SMP TLVs should be addressed according to the SMP state machine.
          * If the received message contains a TLV type 1 (Disconnected):
            * Forget all encryption keys for this correspondent and transition
              the state to `FINISHED`.

      * If you have not sent a message to this correspondent in some
        (configurable) time, send a "heartbeat" message. The heartbeat message
        should have the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.

If the version is 3:

* If msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`:
    * Verify the information (MAC, keyids, ctr value, etc) in the message.
    * If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are
      currently using:
      * Discard the message and optionally warn the user.

    * If the verification succeeds:
      * Decrypt the message and display the human-readable part (if non-empty)
        to the user.
      * Update the D-H encryption keys, if necessary.
      * If you have not sent a message to this correspondent in some
        (configurable) time, send a "heartbeat" message, consisting of a Data
        Message encoding an empty plaintext. The heartbeat message should have
        the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.
      * If the received message contains a TLV type 1, forget all encryption
        keys for this correspondent, and transition msgstate to
        `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`.

    * Otherwise, inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was
      received, and reply with an Error Message, as defined in OTRv3 protocol.

* If msgstate is `MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:
   * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received, and
     reply with an Error Message, as defined in OTRv3 protocol.

#### Receiving an Error Message

* Detect if an error code exists in the form `ERROR_x` where x is a number.
* If the error code exists in the spec:
  * Display the human-readable error message to the user.

* Otherwise:
  * Ignore the message.

If using version 3 and `ERROR_START_AKE` policy is set (which expects that the
AKE will start when receiving an OTR Error message, as defined in OTRv3):

  * Reply with a Query Message.

#### User requests to end an OTR Conversation

* Send a data message with an encoding of the message with an empty
  human-readable part, and the TLV type 1.
* Transition to the `START` state.

## Socialist Millionaires Protocol (SMP)

The Socialist Millionaires Protocol allows two parties with secret information
(`x` and `y`, respectively) to check whether (`x == y`) without revealing any
additional information about the secrets.

OTRv4 makes a few changes to SMP:

  * OTRv4 uses Ed448 as the cryptographic primitive. This changes the way
  values are serialized and how they are computed. To define the SMP values
  under Ed448, we reuse the previously defined generator `G` for Ed448:

  ```
  G = (x=22458004029592430018760433409989603624678964163256413424612546168695
     0415467406032909029192869357953282578032075146446173674602635247710,
     y=29881921007848149267601793044393067343754404015408024209592824137233
     1506189835876003536878655418784733982303233503462500531545062832660)
  ```

  * OTRv4 creates fingerprints using SHAKE-256. The fingerprint is generated as:

      * Use of the first 56 bytes from the `KDF_1(0x00 || byte(H), 56)`

  * SMP in OTRv4 uses all of the [TLV Record Types](#tlv-record-types) as OTRv3,
    except for SMP Message 1Q. When SMP Message 1Q is used in OTRv4, SMP Message
    1 is used in OTRv4. When a question is not present, the user specified
    question section has length `0` and value `NULL`. In OTRv3, SMP Message 1 is
    used when the user does not specify an SMP question. If a question is
    supplied, SMP Message 1Q is used.
  * SMP in OTRv4 uses the same SMP State Machine as OTRv3, with the exception
    that `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` only accepts SMP Message 1. Note that this
    state machine has no effect on type 0 or type 1 TLVs, which are always
    allowed.

### SMP Overview

The computations below use the [SMP Secret Information](#secret-information).

Assuming that Alice begins the exchange:

**Alice:**

* Picks random values `a2` and `a3` in `Z_q`.
* Picks random values `r2` and `r3` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `c2 = HashToScalar(0x01 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - a2 * c2`.
* Computes `c3 = HashToScalar(0x02 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - a3 * c3`.
* Sends Bob a SMP message 1 with `G2a = G * a2`, `c2`, `d2`, `G3a = G * a3`,
  `c3` and `d3`.

**Bob:**

* Validates that `G2a` and `G3a` are on the curve Ed448, that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Picks random values `b2` and `b3` in `Z_q`.
* Picks random values `r2`, `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `r6` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `G2b = G * b2` and `G3b = G * b3`.
* Computes `c2 = HashToScalar(0x03 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - b2 * c2`.
* Computes `c3 = HashToScalar(0x04 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - b3 * c3`.
* Computes `G2 = G2a * b2` and `G3 = G3a * b3`.
* Computes `Pb = G3 * r4` and `Qb = G * r4 + G2 * HashToScalar(y)`, where y is
  the SMP secret value.
* Computes `cp = HashToScalar(5 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
  `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp` and `d6 = r6 - HashToScalar(y) * cp`.
* Sends Alice a SMP message 2 with `G2b`, `c2`, `d2`, `G3b`, `c3`, `d3`, `Pb`,
  `Qb`, `cp`, `d5` and `d6`.

**Alice:**

* Validates that `G2b` and `G3b` are on the curve Ed448, that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Computes `G2 = G2b * a2` and `G3 = G3b * a3`.
* Picks random values `r4`, `r5`, `r6` and `r7` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `Pa = G3 * r4` and `Qa = G * r4 + G2 * HashToScalar(x)`, where x is
  the SMP secret value.
* Computes `cp = HashToScalar(0x06 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
  `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp` and `d6 = r6 - HashToScalar(x) * cp`.
* Computes `Ra = (Qa - Qb) * a3`.
* Computes `cr = HashToScalar(0x07 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and
  `d7 = r7 - a3 * cr`.
* Sends Bob a SMP message 3 with `Pa`, `Qa`, `cp`, `d5`, `d6`, `Ra`, `cr` and
  `d7`.

**Bob:**

* Validates that `Pa`, `Qa`, and `Ra` are on the curve Ed448 that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Picks a random value `r7` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `Rb = (Qa - Qb) * b3`.
* Computes `Rab = Ra * b3`.
* Computes `cr = HashToScalar(0x08 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and
  `d7 = r7 - b3 * cr`.
* Checks whether `Rab == Pa - Pb`.
* Sends Alice a SMP message 4 with `Rb`, `cr`, `d7`.

**Alice:**

* Validates that `Rb` is on curve Ed448. See
  [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
  section for details.
* Computes `Rab = Rb * a3`.
* Checks whether `Rab == Pa - Pb`.

If everything is done correctly, then `Rab` should hold the value of
`(Pa - Pb) * ((G2 * a3 * b3) * (x - y))`.  This test will only succeed if the
secret information provided by each participant are equal (essentially `x == y`).
Further, since `G2 * a3 * b3` is a random number not known to any party, if `x`
is not equal to `y`, no other information is revealed.

### Secret Information

The secret information `x` and `y` compared during this protocol contains not
only information entered by the users, but also information unique to the
conversation in which SMP takes place. This includes the Secure Session ID
(SSID) whose creation is described
[here](#interactive-deniable-authenticated-key-exchange-dake)
and [here](#non-interactive-auth-message).

The format for the secret information is:

```
Version (BYTE)
  The version of SMP used. The version described here is 1.
Initiator fingerprint (64 BYTEs)
  The fingerprint that the party initiating SMP is using in the current
  conversation.
Responder fingerprint (64 BYTEs)
  The fingerprint that the party that did not initiate SMP is using in the
  current conversation.
Secure Session ID or SSID (8 BYTEs)
User-specified secret
  The input string given by the user at runtime.
```

The first 64 bytes of a SHAKE-256 hash of the above is taken, and the digest
becomes the SMP secret value (`x` or `y`) to be used in SMP. The additional
fields ensure that not only do both parties know the same secret input string,
but no man-in-the-middle is capable of reading their communication either.

### SMP Hash Function

There are many places where the first 64 bytes of a SHAKE-256 hash are taken of
an integer followed by other values. This is defined as `HashToScalar(i || v)`
where `i` is an integer used to distinguish the calls to the hash function and
`v` are some values. Hashing is done in this way to prevent Alice from replaying
Bob's zero knowledge proofs or vice versa.

### SMP Message 1

Alice sends SMP message 1 to begin an ECDH exchange to determine two new
generators, `g2` and `g3`. A valid SMP message 1 is generated as follows:

1. Determine her secret input `x`, which is to be compared to Bob's secret
   `y`, as specified in the [Secret Information section](#secret-information).
2. Pick random values `a2` and `a3` in `Z_q`. These will be Alice's exponents
   for the ECDH exchange to pick generators.
3. Pick random values `r2` and `r3` in `Z_q`. These will be used to generate
   zero-knowledge proofs that this message was created according to the SMP
   protocol.
4. Compute `G2a = G * a2` and `G3a = G * a3`.
5. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `a2` is known by setting
   `c2 = HashToScalar(0x01 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - a2 * c2 mod q`.
6. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `a3` is known by setting
   `c3 = HashToScalar(0x02 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - a3 * c3 mod q`.
7. Store the values of `x`, `a2` and `a3` for use later in the protocol.


The SMP message 1 has the following data and format:

```
Question (DATA)
  A user-specified question, which is associated with the user-specified secret
  information. If there is no question input from the user, the length of this
  is 0 and the data is 'NULL'.

G2a (POINT)
  Alice's half of the ECDH exchange to determine G2.

c2 (SCALAR), d2 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Alice knows the value associated with her
  transmitted value G2a.

G3a (POINT)
  Alice's half of the ECDH exchange to determine G3.

c3 (SCALAR), d3 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Alice knows the value associated with her
  transmitted value G3a.

```

### SMP Message 2

SMP message 2 is sent by Bob to complete the ECDH exchange to determine the new
generators, `g2` and `g3`. It also begins the construction of the values used in
the final comparison of the protocol. A valid SMP message 2 is generated as
follows:

1. Validate that `G2a` and `G3a` are on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
2. Determine Bob's secret input `y`, which is to be compared to Alice's secret
   `x`.
3. Pick random values `b2` and `b3` in `Z_q`. These will be used for creating
   the generators `g2` and `g3`.
4. Pick random values `r2`, `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `r6` in `Z_q`. These
   will be used to add a blinding factor to the final results, and to generate
   zero-knowledge proofs that this message was created honestly.
5. Compute `G2b = G * b2` and `G3b = G * b3`.
6. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `b2` is known by setting
   `c2 = HashToScalar(0x03 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - b2 * c2 mod q`.
7. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `b3` is known by setting
   `c3 = HashToScalar(0x04 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - b3 * c3 mod q`.
8. Compute `G2 = G2a * b2` and `G3 = G3a * b3`.
9. Compute `Pb = G3 * r4` and `Qb = G * r4 + G2 * HashToScalar(y)`.
10. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that `Pb` and `Qb` were created according
   to the protocol by setting
   `cp = HashToScalar(0x05 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
   `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp mod q` and `d6 = r6 - HashToScalar(y) * cp mod q`.
11. Store the values of `G3a`, `G2`, `G3`, `b3`, `Pb` and `Qb` for use later
    in the protocol.

The SMP message 2 has the following data and format:

```
G2b (POINT)
  Bob's half of the DH exchange to determine G2.

c2 (SCALAR), d2 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Bob knows the exponent associated with his
  transmitted value G2b.

G3b (POINT)
  Bob's half of the ECDH exchange to determine G3.

c3 (SCALAR), d3 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Bob knows the exponent associated with his
  transmitted value G3b.

Pb (POINT), Qb (POINT)
  These values are used in the final comparison to determine if Alice and Bob
  share the same secret.

cp (SCALAR), d5 (SCALAR), d6 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Pb and Qb were created according to the protocol
  given above.
```

### SMP Message 3

SMP message 3 is Alice's final message in the SMP exchange. It has the last of
the information required by Bob to determine if `x = y`. A valid SMP message 3
is generated as follows:

1. Validate that `G2b`, `G3b`, `Pb`, and `Qb` are on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
2. Pick random values `r4`, `r5`, `r6` and `r7` in `Z_q`. These will be used to
   add a blinding factor to the final results and to generate zero-knowledge
   proofs that this message was created honestly.
3. Compute `G2 = G2b * a2` and `G3 = G3b * a3`.
4. Compute `Pa = G3 * r4` and `Qa = G * r4 + G2 * HashToScalar(x)`.
5. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that `Pa` and `Qa` were created according to
   the protocol by setting
   `cp = HashToScalar(0x06 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
   `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp mod q` and `d6 = r6 - HashToScalar(x) * cp mod q`.
6. Compute `Ra = (Qa - Qb) * a3`.
7. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that `Ra` was created according to the
   protocol by setting `cr = HashToScalar(0x07 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and
   `d7 = r7 - a3 * cr mod q`.
8. Store the values of `G3b`, `Pa - Pb`, `Qa - Qb` and `a3` for use later in
   the protocol.

The SMP message 3 has the following data and format:

```
Pa (POINT), Qa (POINT)
  These values are used in the final comparison to determine if Alice and Bob
  share the same secret.

cp (SCALAR), d5 (SCALAR), d6 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Pa and Qa were created according to the protocol
  given above.

Ra (POINT)
  This value is used in the final comparison to determine if Alice and Bob share
  the same secret.

cr (SCALAR), d7 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Ra was created according to the protocol given
  above.
```

### SMP Message 4

SMP message 4 is Bob's final message in the SMP exchange. It has the last of the
information required by Alice to determine if `x = y`. A valid SMP message 4 is
generated as follows:

1. Validate that `Pa`, `Qa`, and `Ra` are on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
2. Pick a random value `r7` in `Z_q`. This will be used to generate Bob's final
   zero-knowledge proof that this message was created honestly.
3. Compute `Rb = (Qa - Qb) * b3`.
4. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that `Rb` was created according to the
   protocol by setting
   `cr = HashToScalar(0x08 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)`
   and `d7 = r7 - b3 * cr mod q`.

The SMP message 4 has the following data and format:

```
Rb (POINT)
  This value is used in the final comparison to determine if Alice and Bob
  share the same secret.

cr (SCALAR), d7 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Rb was created according to this SMP protocol.
```

### The SMP State Machine

OTRv4 does not change the state machine for SMP from OTRv3. But the following
sections detail how values are computed differently during some states. Each
case assumes that the protocol state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`. It must be taken
into account that state `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` is reached whenever an error occurs
or SMP is aborted. In that case, the protocol must be restarted from the
beginning.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 1

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a SMP abort to Alice.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

* Verify Alice's zero-knowledge proofs for G2a and G3a:
  1. Check that both `G2a` and `G3a` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  2. Check that `c2 = HashToScalar(0x01 || G * d2 + G2a * c2)`.
  3. Check that `c3 = HashToScalar(0x02 || G * d3 + G3a * c3)`.
* Create a SMP message 2 and send it to Alice.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 2

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT2`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a SMP abort to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT2`:

* Verify Bob's zero-knowledge proofs for `G2b`, `G3b`, `Pb` and `Qb`:
  1. Check that `G2b`, `G3b`, `Pb` and `Qb` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  2. Check that `c2 = HashToScalar(0x03 || G * d2 + G2b * c2)`.
  3. Check that `c3 = HashToScalar(0x04 || G * d3 + G3b * c3)`.
  4. Check that `cp = HashToScalar(0x05 || G3 * d5 + Pb * cp || G * d5 + G2 *
     d6 + Qb * cp)`.
* Create SMP message 3 and send it to Bob.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 3

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a SMP abort to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`:

* Verify Alice's zero-knowledge proofs for `Pa`, `Qa` and `Ra`:
  1. Check that `Pa`, `Qa` and `Ra` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  2. Check that `cp = HashToScalar(0x06 || G3 * d5 + Pa * cp || G * d5 + G2 *
     d6 + Qa * cp)`.
  3. Check that `cr = HashToScalar(0x07 || G * d7 + G3a * cr || (Qa - Qb) * d7 +
     Ra * cr)`.
* Create a SMP message 4 and send it to Alice.
* Check whether the protocol was successful:
  1. Compute `Rab = Ra * b3`.
  2. Determine if `x = y` by checking the equivalent condition that
     `Pa - Pb = Rab`.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`, as no more messages are expected from
  Alice.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 4

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a type 6 TLV (SMP abort) to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`:

* Verify Bob's zero-knowledge proof for Rb:
   1. Check that `Rb` is on curve Ed448. See
      [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
      section for details.
   2. Check that `cr = HashToScalar(0x08 || G * d7 + G3b * cr || (Qa - Qb) *
      d7 + Rb * cr)`.
* Check whether the protocol was successful:
    1. `Compute Rab = Rb * a3`.
    2. Determine if `x = y` by checking the equivalent condition that
       `(Pa - Pb) = Rab`.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`, as no more messages are expected
  from Bob.

## Implementation Notes

### Considerations for Networks that allow Multiple Devices

When using a transport network that allows multiple devices to be
simultaneously logged in with the same peer identifier, make sure to identify
the other participant by its device-specific identifier and not only the peer
identifier (for example, using XMPP full JID instead of bare JID). Doing so
allows establishing multiple OTR channels at the same time with multiple devices
from the other participant. This can cost that the client manages this exposure
(for example, XMPP clients can decide to reply only to the device you have more
recently received a message from).

## Forging Transcripts

OTRv4 expects each implementation of this specification to expose an interface
for producing forged transcripts. These forging operations must use the same
functions used for honest conversations. This section will outline the
operations that must be exposed and include guidance to forge messages.

In OTRv4, anyone can forge messages after a conversation to make them look like
they came from them. However, during a conversation, your correspondent is
assured that the messages they see are authentic and unmodified. Easily
forgeable transcripts achieve the offline deniability property: if someone
claims a participant said something over OTR, they'll have no way to proof so,
as anyone could have modify a transcript.

The major utilities for forging are:

```
Parse
  Parses OTRv4 messages to the values of each of the fields in them and shows
  these fields.

Modify Data Message
  If an encrypted data message cannot be read because you don't know the message
  key (or one of the chain keys used to derive this message key) but it can be
  guessed that the string 'x' appears at a given place in the message, a
  participant can replace that string with some new desired text with the same
  length. The result is a valid OTRv4 message that contains the new text. For
  example, if the string "hi" is accurately guessed to be at the beginning of
  an encrypted message, it can be replaced with the string "yo". Therefore, a
  valid data message can be created with new text.

  To achieve this:
  - XOR the old text and the new text. Store this value.
  - XOR the stored value again with the original encrypted message starting
    at a given offset.
  - Recalculate the MAC tag with the revealed MAC key associated with this
    message. The new tag is attached to the data message, replacing the old
    value.
```

[Pseudocode](#modify-an-encrypted-data-message) for modifying data messages is
included in the [Appendices](#appendices).

```
Read and Forge Data Message
  Read and forge allows someone in possession of a chain key to decrypt OTR
  messages or modify them as forgeries. It takes three inputs: the chain key,
  the OTRv4 message and a new plain text message (optional). If a new
  message is included, the original text is replaced with the new message and
  a new MAC tag is attached to the data message.

  To achieve this:
  - Decrypt the data message with the corresponding message key derived from
    the given chain key.
  - If a new message is given, replace the message with that one, encrypt it
    and create its mac accordingly.

Forge DAKE and Session Keys
  Any participant of an OTR conversation may forge a DAKE with another
  participant as long as they have their User Profile. This function will
  take the User Profile and the secret long term key of one participant, and
  the User Profile of the other. It will return a DAKE transcript between
  the two parties. The participant's private key is required since it is used
  to authenticate the key exchange, but the resulting transcript is created
  in such a way that a cryptographic expert cannot identify which user
  profile owner authenticated the conversation.

Show MAC Key
  This function takes a chain key and the number of a message key, and shows
  the MAC key associated with those two values. For example, if the message
  key number is 3, the chain key is ratcheted 3 times, and the third MAC key is
  derived and returned. 'Show MAC key' may be used with the ReMAC Message
  function below in the case where a chain key has been compromised by an
  attacker who wishes to forge messages.

ReMAC Message
  This will make a new OTR Data Message with a given MAC key and an original
  OTR data message. The user's message in the OTR data message is already
  encrypted. A new MAC tag will be generated and replaced for the message. An
  attacker may use this function to forge messages with a compromised MAC key.

Forge Entire Transcript
  The Forge Entire Transcript function will allow one participant to completely
  forge a transcript between them and another person in a way that its forgery
  cannot be cryptographically proven. The input will be: one participant's user
  profile, their secret key, another participant's User Profile, and a list of
  plain text messages corresponding to what messages were exchanged. Each
  message in the list will have the structure: 1) sender 2) plain text message,
  so that the function may precisely create the desired transcript. The
  participant's private key is required since it is used to authenticate the key
  exchange, but the resulting transcript is created in such a way that a
  cryptographic expert cannot identify which User Profile owner authenticated
  the conversation.
```

### Ring Signature Authentication

The Authentication scheme consists of two functions:

- An authentication function: `sigma = RSig(A1, a1, {A1, A2, A3}, m)`.
- A verification function: `RVrf({A1, A2, A3}, sigma, m)`.

#### Domain Parameters

We reuse the previously defined G generator in elliptic curve parameters:

```
G = (x=22458004029592430018760433409989603624678964163256413424612546168695
       0415467406032909029192869357953282578032075146446173674602635247710,
     y=29881921007848149267601793044393067343754404015408024209592824137233
       1506189835876003536878655418784733982303233503462500531545062832660)

```

#### Authentication: RSig(A1, a1, {A1, A2, A3}, m):

`RSig` produces a SoK (signature of knowledge), named `sigma`, bound to the
message `m`, that demonstrates knowledge of a private key corresponding to one
of three public keys.

In the case the DAKEs used for interactive and non-interactive, `A1` is the
public value associated with `a1`, that is, `A1 = G * a1` and `m` is the message
to authenticate.

To compute `RSig`, without loss of generality:

`A1`, `A2`, and `A3` should be checked to verify that they are on the curve
Ed448. See
[Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
section for details.

1. Pick random values `t1, c2, c3, r2, r3` in `q`.
2. Compute `T1 = G * t1`.
3. Compute `T2 = G * r2 + A2 * c2`.
4. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`.
5. Compute `c = HashToScalar(0x29 || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 ||
   T3 || m)`.
6. Compute `c1 = c - c2 - c3 (mod q)`.
7. Compute `r1 = t1 - c1 * a1 (mod q)`.
8. Send `sigma = (c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.

This function can be generalized so it is not possible to determine which secret
key was used to produce this ring signature, even if all secret keys are
revealed. For this, constant-time conditional operations should be used. For
details on how to implement these operations, see the
[Constant-time Operations](#constant-time-operations) section.

The prover knows a secret `ai` and, therefore:

1. Pick random values `t1, c2, c3, r2, r3` in `q`.
2. Compute:

```
  P = G * ai
  eq1 = constant_time_eq(P, A1)
  eq2 = constant_time_eq(P, A2)
  eq3 = constant_time_eq(P, A3)
```

3. Depending the result of the above operations, compute:

```
  T1 = constant_time_select(eq1, encode(G * t1), encode(G * r1 + A1 * c1))
  T2 = constant_time_select(eq2, encode(G * t2), encode(G * r2 + A2 * c2))
  T3 = constant_time_select(eq3, encode(G * t3), encode(G * r3 + A3 * c3))
```

4. Compute `c = HashToScalar(0x29 || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 ||
   T3 || m)`.
5. For whichever equally returns true (if `eqi == 1`, `eqj == 0` and
   `eqk == 0`, for `i != j != k`): `ci = c - cj - ck (mod q)`.
6. For whichever equally returns true (if `eqi == 1`):
   `ri = ti - ci * ai (mod q)`.
7. Compute `sigma = (ci, ri, cj, rj, ck, rk)`.

If the prover knows `a2`, for example, the `RSig` function looks like this:
`RSig(A2, a2, {A1, A2, A3}, m)`

1. Pick random values `t2, c1, c3, r1, r3` in `q`.
2. Compute `T2 = G * t2`.
3. Compute `T1 = G * r1 + A1 * c1`.
4. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`.
5. Compute `c = HashToScalar(0x29 || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 ||
   T3 || m)`.
6. Compute `c2 = c - c1 - c3 (mod q)`.
7. Compute `r2 = t2 - c2 * a2 (mod q)`.
8. Send `sigma = (c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.

The order of elements passed to `H` and sent to the verifier must not depend
on the secret known by the prover (otherwise, the key used to produce the proof
can be inferred in practice).

#### Verification: RVrf({A1, A2, A3}, sigma, m)

`RVrf` is the verification function for the SoK `sigma`, created by `RSig`.

`A1`, `A2`, and `A3` should be checked to verify that they are on curve Ed448.

1. Parse `sigma` to retrieve components `(c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.
2. Compute `T1 = G * r1 + A1 * c1`
3. Compute `T2 = G * r2 + A2 * c2`
4. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`
5. Compute `c = HashToScalar(0x29 || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 ||
   T3 || m)`.
6. Check if `c ≟ c1 + c2 + c3 (mod q)`. If it is true, verification succeeds.
   If not, it fails.

### HashToScalar

This function is `HashToScalar(d)`: d is an array of bytes.

1. Compute `h = KDF_1(d, 64)` as an unsigned value, little-endian.
2. Return `h (mod q)`

### Modify an Encrypted Data Message

In this example, a forger guesses that "hi" is at the beginning of an encrypted
message. Thus, its offset is 0. The forger wants to replace "hi" with "yo".

```
  offset = 0
  old_text = "hi"
  new_text = "yo"
  text_length = string_length_of(old_text)
  old_encrypted_message = get_from_data_message()
  encrypted_message_length = string_length_of(old_encrypted_message)

  for (i=0; i < text_length && offset+i < encrypted_message_length; i++) {
      old_encrypted_message[offset+i] ^= old_text[i] ^ new_text[i]
  }

  new_encrypted_message = old_encrypted_message

  new_mac_tag = mac(new_encrypted_message, revealed_mac_key)

  new_data_message = replace(old_data_message, new_encrypted_message, new_mac_tag)

```

### OTRv3 Specific Encoded Messages

#### D-H Commit Message

This is the first message of OTRv3 AKE. Bob sends it to Alice to commit to a
choice of D-H encryption key (but the key itself is not yet revealed). This
allows the secure session id to be much shorter than in OTRv1, while still
preventing a man-in-the-middle attack on it.

The D-H Commit Message consists of the protocol version, the message type, the
sender's instance tag, the receiver's instance tag, the encoded encrypted
sender's public key and the hashed sender's public key.

#### D-H Key Message

This is the second message of OTRv3 AKE. Alice sends it to Bob.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag and the public key.

#### Reveal Signature Message

This is the third message of the OTRv3 AKE. Bob sends it to Alice, revealing his
D-H encryption key (and thus opening an encrypted channel), and also
authenticating himself (and the parameters of the channel, preventing a
man-in-the-middle attack on the channel itself) to Alice.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag, the revealed key, the encrypted signature and
the MAC of the signature.

#### Signature Message

This is the final message of the OTRv3 AKE. Alice sends it to Bob,
authenticating herself and the channel parameters to him.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag, the encrypted signature and the MAC of the
signature.

#### Data Message

In OTRv3, this message is used to transmit a private message to the
correspondent. It is also used to reveal old MAC keys.

#### Receiving a D-H Commit Message

If the message is version 3 and version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore the message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`:

  * Reply with a `D-H Key Message`, and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`:

  * This indicates that you have already sent a `D-H Commit message` to your
    peer, but that it either didn't receive it, or just didn't receive it yet
    and has sent you one as well. The symmetry will be broken by comparing the
    hashed `g^x` you sent in your `D-H Commit Message` with the one you
    received, considered as 32-byte unsigned big-endian values.

  * If yours is the higher hash value:

    * Ignore the incoming `D-H Commit message`, but resend your
      `D-H Commit message`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Forget the old encrypted `g^x` value that you sent earlier, and pretend
      you're in `AUTHSTATE_NONE`. For example, reply with a `D-H Key Message`,
      and transition `authstate` to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Retransmit your `D-H Key Message` (the same one you sent when you entered
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`). Forget the old `D-H Commit message` and
    use this new one instead.

    There are a number of reasons this might happen, including:

    * Your correspondent simply started a new AKE.
    * Your correspondent resent his `D-H Commit message`, as specified above.
    * On some networks, like AIM, if your correspondent is logged in multiple
      times, each of his clients will send a `D-H Commit Message` in response
      to a Query Message. Resending the same `D-H Key Message` in response to
      each of those messages will prevent confusion, since each of the clients
      will see each of the `D-H Key Messages` sent.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Reply with a new `D-H Key message` and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

#### Receiving a D-H Key Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using:

  * Ignore the message.

If the message is version 3 and version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`:

  * Reply with a `Reveal Signature Message` and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * If this `D-H Key message` is the same you received earlier (when you entered
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`):
    * Retransmit your `Reveal Signature Message`.

  * Otherwise:
    * Ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`, or
`AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP`:

  * Ignore the message.

#### Receiving a Reveal Signature Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If version 3 is not allowed:

   * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Use the received value of `r` to decrypt the value of `g^x` received in the
    D-H Commit Message, and verify the hash therein.
  * Decrypt the encrypted signature, and verify the signature and the MACs. If
    everything checks out:

    * Reply with a Signature Message.
    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_NONE`.
    * Transition msgstate to `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`.
    * If there is a recent stored message, encrypt it and send it as a Data
      Message.

  * Otherwise:

    * Ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY` or
`AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Ignore the message.

#### Receiving a Signature Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using:

  * Ignore the message.

If version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Decrypt the encrypted signature, and verify the signature and the MACs. If
    everything checks out:

    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_NONE`.
    * Transition msgstate to `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`.
    * If there is a recent stored message, encrypt it and send it as a Data
      Message.

  * Otherwise, ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`
or `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Ignore the message.

#### Sending a TLV type 1 (Disconnected) Message

If the user requests to close its private connection, you may send a message
(possibly with an empty human-readable part) containing a record with TLV type 1
just before you discard the session keys. You should then transition to
`MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT`.

### OTRv3 Protocol State Machine

OTRv3 defines three main state variables:

#### Message State

The message state variable `msgstate` controls what happens to outgoing messages
typed by the user. It can take one of three values:

```
MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent without encryption. This
  is the state used before an OTRv3 conversation is initiated. This is the
  initial state, and the only way to subsequently enter this state is for the
  user to explicitly request so via some UI operation.

MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent encrypted. This is the
  state that is used during an OTRv3 conversation. The only way to enter this
  state is when the authentication state machine (below) is completed.

MSGSTATE_FINISHED
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are not delivered at all. This
  state is entered only when the other party indicates that its side of the
  conversation has ended. For example, if Alice and Bob are having an OTR
  conversation, and Bob instructs his OTR client to end its private session with
  Alice (for example, by logging out), Alice will be notified of this, and her
  client will switch to 'MSGSTATE_FINISHED' mode. This prevents Alice from
  accidentally sending a message to Bob in plaintext (consider what happens if
  Alice was in the middle of typing a private message to Bob when he suddenly
  logs out, just as Alice hits Enter.)
```

#### Authentication State

The authentication state variable `authstate` can take one of four values:

```
AUTHSTATE_NONE
  This state indicates that the authentication protocol is not currently in
  progress. This is the initial state.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY
  After Bob initiates the authentication protocol by sending Alice the 'D-H
  Commit Message', he enters this state to await Alice's reply.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG
  After Alice receives Bob's D-H Commit Message, and replies with her own 'D-H
  Key Message', she enters this state to await Bob's reply.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG
  After Bob receives Alice's 'D-H Key Message', and replies with his own Reveal
  Signature Message, he enters this state to await Alice's reply.

```

### Elliptic Curve Operations

#### Point Addition

For point addition, the following method is recommended, as defined in RFC 8032.
A point `(x,y)` is represented in projective coordinates `(X, Y, Z)`, with
`x = X/Z`, `y = Y/Z` with `Z != 0`.

The neutral point is `(0,1)`, or equivalently in projective coordinates
`(0, Z, Z)` for any non-zero `Z`.

The following formula is for adding two points, `(x3,y3) = (x1,y1) + (x2,y2)`
(or `X_1 : Y_1 : Z_1) + X_2 : Y_2 : Z_2 = X_3 : Y_3 : Z_3`) on untwisted Edwards
curve (i.e., `a = 1`) with non-square `d`, as defined in [\[10\]](#references).
They are complete (they work for any pair of valid input points):

Compute:

```
                 A = Z1 * Z2
                 B = A^2
                 C = X1 * X2
                 D = Y1 * Y2
                 E = d * C * D
                 F = B - E
                 G = B + E
                 H = (X1 + Y1) * (X2 + Y2)
                 X3 = A * F * (H - C - D)
                 Y3 = A * G * (D - C)
                 Z3 = F * G
```

### Constant-time Operations

#### Constant-time Equality

A constant-time equality function should return `1` if `x == y` and `0`
otherwise.

```
constant_time_equals(x, y):
  if len(x) != len(y)
    return 0

  result = 0

  for i = 0; i < len(x); i++
    result |= x[i] ^ y[i]

  return 1 & ~((-result) >> 8)
```

#### Constant-time Selection

A constant-time selection function should return `x` if `v` is `1` and `y` if
`v` is `0`. The behavior is undefined if `v` takes any other value.

```
constant_time_select(v, x, y):
  return ((-v) & x) | ((v - 1) & y)
```
