# OTR version 4

```
Disclaimer

This protocol specification is a draft. It's currently under constant revision.
```

This document describes version 4 of the Off-the-Record Messaging protocol.
OTR version 4 (OTRv4) provides better deniability properties by the use of a
deniable authenticated key exchange (DAKE), and better forward secrecy through
the use of double ratcheting. OTRv4 works on top of an existing messaging
protocol, such as XMPP.

## Main Changes over Version 3

- Security level raised to 224 bits and based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  (ECC).
- Additional protection against transcript decryption in the case of ECC
  compromise.
- Support of conversations where one party is offline.
- Updated cryptographic primitives and protocols:
  - Deniable authenticated key exchanges (DAKE) using "DAKE with Zero Knowledge"
    (DAKEZ) and "Extended Zero-knowledge Diffie-Hellman" (XZDH)
    [\[1\]](#references).
    DAKEZ corresponds to conversations when both parties are online
    (interactive) and XZDH to conversations when one of the parties is offline
    (non-interactive).
  - Key management using the Double Ratchet Algorithm [\[2\]](#references).
  - Upgraded SHA-1 and SHA-2 to SHAKE-256.
  - Switched from AES to ChaCha20 [\[3\]](#references). The RFC 7539 variant is
    used [\[16\]](#references) .
- Support of an out-of-order network model.
- Support of different modes in which this specification can be implemented.
- Explicit instructions for producing forged transcripts using the same
  functions used to conduct honest conversations.

Reasons for the decisions made above and more are included in the [architectural
decisions records](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/architecture-decisions).

## High Level Overview

An OTRv4 conversation may begin when the two participants are online (an
interactive conversation) or when one participant is offline (non-interactive
conversation).

### Conversation started by an Interactive DAKE

```
Alice                                                Bob
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requests OTR conversation            ------------->

Establishes Conversation with DAKEZ  <------------>  Establishes Conversation with DAKEZ

Exchanges Data Messages              <------------>  Exchanges Data Messages
```

The conversation can begin after one participant requests a conversation. This
includes an advertisement of which versions the participant supports. If the
other participant supports OTRv4, an interactive DAKE can be used to establish a
secure channel. Encrypted messages are then exchanged in this secure channel
with strong forward secrecy.

### Conversation started by a Non-Interactive DAKE

```
Alice                             Untrusted Prekey Server    Bob
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  (<----------------------   Pre-conversation: Creates
                                                             and sends Prekey Ensembles: creates
                                                             a Client Profile, a Prekey Profile and a set of
                                                             prekey messages)
Retrieves Bob's  ----------------->
Prekey Ensemble: asks for
a Client Profile, a Prekey
Profile and a prekey message

Establishes Conversation  -------------------------------->
with XZDH and sends the
first Data Message

Exchanges Data Messages <---------------------------------> Exchanges Data Messages
```

The conversation can begin when one participant retrieves the other's
participant Prekey Ensemble from an untrusted Prekey Server (consisting of a
Client Profile, a Prekey Profile and a set of prekey messages). Prior to the
start of the conversation, these Prekey values would have had to be uploaded by
the other participant's client to a server. This have to be done so other
participants, like Alice, can send messages to the other participant, like Bob,
while the latter is offline.

### Definitions

Unless otherwise noted, these conventions and definitions are used for this
document:

* "Adversary" refers to a malicious entity whose aim is to prevent the
  participants of this protocol from achieving their goal.
* "Client" refers to a software used for communication between parties. It
  implements the OTRv4 protocol.
* "OTR Conversation" and "Conversation" refers to an interaction between parties
  by exchanging encrypted messages with each other using the OTRv4 protocol.
* "DAKE" refers to a Deniable Authenticated Key Exchange, in which two parties
  engage in the protocol whose result is a key which only the two of them know,
  and they are assured to be sharing it with each other. They will use
  it to encrypt and authenticate messages in the session, using an
  authentication mechanism that is deniable provided that the key cannot be
  traced to either party.
* "Informant" refers to an insider with privileged access capable of divulging
  information.
* "Initiator" refers to the participant initiating a DAKE. In the case of the
  interactive DAKE, this is the participant that sends the Identity message.
  In the case of the non-interactive DAKE, this is the participant that
  uploads a Prekey Ensemble.
* "Judge" refers to an entity that decide whether or not a certain event
  occurred. We say that an action is deniable with respect to a given judge if
  the judge cannot be convinced that an individual performed the action.
* "Mode" refers to a way in which OTRv4 can be implemented.
* "Network" refers to the system that computing devices use to exchange data
  with each other using connections between nodes.
* "Participant" or "Party" refers to any of the end-points that take part in a
  conversation.
* "Prekey Server" refers to the untrusted server used to store Prekey Ensembles.
* "Publisher" refers to the participant publishing Prekey Ensembles to the
  Prekey Server.
* "Receiver" refers to the participant receiving an encoded message.
* "Responder" refers to the participant responding to an Initiator's request.
  In the case of the interactive DAKE, this is the participant that sends the
  Auth-R message. In the case of the non-interactive DAKE, this is the
  participant that sends the Non-Interactive Auth message.
* "Retriever" refers to the participant retrieving Prekey Ensembles from the
  Prekey Server that correspond to the Publisher.
* "Sender" refers to the participant sending an encoded message.
* "Session" refers to a semi-permanent information interchange between parties.
  It is not only limited to the exchange of encrypted messages.

## Assumptions

Messages in a conversation can be exchanged over an insecure channel, where an
attacker can eavesdrop or interfere with the messages.

The network model provides in-order and out-of-order delivery of messages. Some
messages may not be delivered.

OTRv4 does not protect against an active attacker performing Denial of Service
attacks.

## Security Properties

OTRv4 is the version 4 of the cryptographic protocol OTR. It provides end-to-end
encryption, which is a system by which information is sent over a network in
such a way that only the recipient and sender can read it.

OTRv4 provides trust establishment (user verification) by fingerprint
verification or by the ability to perform the Socialist Millionaires Protocol
(SMP). The latter is a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol that
determines if secret values held by two parties are equal without revealing the
value itself.

OTRv4 uses two kinds of Deniable Authenticated Key Exchanges (DAKE), as stated
above: one for interactive conversations and one for non-interactive
conversations.

In the interactive DAKE, although access to one participant's private long-term
key is required for authentication, both participants can deny having used
their private long-term keys. A forged transcript of the DAKE can be produced
by anyone who knows the long-term public keys of both alleged
participants. This capability is called offline deniability because no
transcript provides evidence of a past key exchange, as it could have being
forged by anyone. This property is provided for both participants taking part in
the interactive DAKE as described below.

Furthermore, participants in the interactive DAKE, cannot provide proof of
participation to third parties without making themselves vulnerable to Key
Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attacks [\[11\]](#references), even if they
perform arbitrary protocols with these third parties. A KCI attack begins when
the long-term secret key of a participant of a vulnerable DAKE is compromised.
With this secret key, an adversary can impersonate other users to the owner of
the key. The property by which participants cannot provide proof of
participation to third parties is known as online deniability. Notice that OTRv4
uses 'forging keys' to provide online deniability and to prevent KCI attacks at
the same time. For a detailed explanation around how forging keys work in
regards to online deniability and KCI attacks, refer to
section [KCI attacks](#kci-attacks).

Online deniability can be broken in two ways: 1. coercive judges, when an
online judge coerces a participant into interactively proving that messages were
authored by a victim, without compromising long-term secrets; 2. malicious
users, when a malicious participant interacts with a purpose-built third-party
service during a conversation with a victim to produce non-repudiable proof of
message authorship by the victim. This second attack can happen with the help
of remote attestation, where an adversary uses it on a participant's client
to produce a non-repudiable proof/transcript of the otherwise deniable protocol
[\[12\]](#references).

Both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive) provide offline deniability as
anyone can forge a DAKE transcript between two parties using their long-term
public keys. The interactive DAKE provides online deniability for both
parties.

In the non-interactive DAKE, the initiator (Bob, in the above overview) has
online deniability, but Alice, the responder, does not. This happens as
there can exist a protocol whereby a third party, with Alice's help, can
establish an authenticated conversation with Bob in Alice's name without having
to learn her private keys. This generates irrefutable cryptographic proof that a
conversation took place.

Although both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive) provide deniability, take
into account that there may be a loss of deniability if an interactive DAKE is
followed by a non-interactive one.

Once a conversation has been established with the DAKE, all data messages
transmitted in it are confidential and retain their integrity. They are
authenticated using a MAC. As MAC keys are published and OTRv4 uses malleable
encryption, anyone can forge data messages, and consequently, deny their
contents.

Furthermore, OTRv4 provides forward secrecy. An adversary that compromises the
long-term secret keys of both parties cannot retroactively compromise past
session keys. The interactive DAKE offers strong forward secrecy (it protects
the session key when at least one party completes the exchange). The
non-interactive DAKE offers a forward secrecy that is between strong and
weak, as it protects completed sessions and incomplete sessions that stall long
enough to be invalidated by a participant. The key exchange mechanism used
in OTRv4 is the Double Ratchet algorithm which provides forward and backward
secrecy, as parties negotiate secrets several times using an ephemeral key
exchange.

A protocol provides forward secrecy if the compromise of a long-term key does
not allow ciphertexts encrypted with previous session keys to be decrypted. If
the compromise of a long-term key does not allow subsequent ciphertexts to be
decrypted by passive attackers, then the protocol is said to have backward
secrecy. Furthermore, if the compromise of a single session key is not
permanent, as, after some time, subsequent messages will be impossible to
decrypt again because of the "self-healing" nature of the algorithm, then the
protocol is said to have post-compromise security. In the current academic
literature, backwards secrecy is included in post-compromise security. OTRv4, by
using the Double Ratchet Algorithm, provides these two properties: forward
secrecy and post-compromise security. If key material used to encrypt a
particular data message is compromised, previous and future messages are
protected.

The DAKEs in OTRv4 provide contributiveness as well. This means that the
initiator of the protocol cannot force the shared secret to take on a specific
value. It is also computationally infeasible for the responder to select a
specific shared secret. Additionally, both DAKEs in this specification are
provable secure, meaning that both of them come with a rigorous logical
argument as proof.

OTRv4 does not take advantage of quantum resistant algorithms. There are several
reasons for this. Mainly, OTRv4 aims to be a protocol that is easy to implement
in today's environments and within a year. Current quantum resistant algorithms
and their respective implementations are not ready enough to allow for this
implementation time frame. As a result, the properties mentioned in these
paragraphs only apply to non-quantum adversaries.

The only exception is the usage of a "brace key" to provide some
post-conversation transcript protection against potential weaknesses of elliptic
curves and the early arrival of quantum computers. Nevertheless, notice that the
"brace key" does not provide any kind of post-quantum confidentiality.
When fault-tolerant quantum computers break Ed448-Goldilocks keys, it will take
some years beyond that point to break 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman keys.

These security properties only hold for when a conversation with OTRv4 is
started. They do not hold for the previous versions of the OTR protocol, meaning
that if a user that supports version 3 and 4 starts a conversation with someone
that only supports version 3, a conversation with OTRv3 will start, and its
security properties will not be the ones stated in these paragraphs.

## OTRv4 Modes

In order for OTRv4 to be an alternative to current messaging applications, to
be compatible with the OTRv3 specification and to be useful for instant
messaging protocols (e.g. XMPP), the OTRv4 protocol must define different modes
in which it can be implemented: a OTRv3-compatible mode, a OTRv4 standalone
mode, and a OTRv4 interactive-only-mode. These are the three modes enforced by
this protocol specification; but, it must be taken into account, that OTRv4 can
and may be also implemented in other modes.

The modes are:

1. OTRv3-compatible mode: a mode with backwards compatibility with OTRv3. This
   mode will know how to handle plaintext messages, including query messages and
   whitespace tags.
1. OTRv4-standalone mode: an always encrypted mode. This mode will not know how
   to handle any kind of plaintext messages, including query messages and
   whitespace tags. It supports both interactive and non-interactive
   conversations. It is not backwards compatible with OTRv3.
1. OTRv4-interactive-only: an always encrypted mode that provides higher
   deniability properties when compared to the previous two modes, as it
   achieves offline and online deniability for both participants in a
   conversation. It only supports interactive conversations. It is not backwards
   compatible with OTRv3. This mode can be used by network models that do not
   have a central infrastructure, like Ricochet (keep in mind, though, that if
   OTRv4 is used over Ricochet, some online deniability properties will be
   lost).

For details on how these modes work, and how the DAKEs and double ratchet is
initialized in them, review the
[modes](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/modes) folder.

Take into account, that some clients might implement different modes when
talking with each other. In those cases:

* If a client implements "OTRv4-standalone" mode or "OTRv4-interactive-only"
  mode and a request for an OTRv3 conversation arrives, reject this request.
* If a client implements "OTRv4-interactive-only" mode and a request for an
  offline conversation arrives, reject this request.

The OTRv4 state machine will also need to know the mode in which is working on
when initialized. It will also need to take this mode into account every time it
makes a decision around how to transition from every state.

## Notation and Parameters

This section contains information needed to understand the parameters, variables
and arithmetic used in the specification.

### Notation

Scalars and secret keys are in lower case, such as `x` or `y`. Points and public
keys are in upper case, such as `P` or `Q`.

Addition of elliptic curve points `A` and `B` is `A + B`. Subtraction is
`A - B`. Addition of a point to another point generates a third point. Scalar
multiplication of an elliptic curve point `B` with a scalar `a` yields a new
point: `C = B * a`. For details on how to implement these operations, see the
[Elliptic Curve Operations](#elliptic-curve-operations) section.

The concatenation of byte sequences `I` and `J` is `I || J`. In this case, `I`
and `J` represent a fixed-length byte sequence encoding of the respective
values. See the section on [Data Types](#data-types) for encoding and decoding
details.

A scalar modulo `q` is a field element, and should be encoded and decoded
as a `SCALAR` type, which is defined in the [Data Types](#data-types) section.

A point should be encoded and decoded as a `POINT` type, which is defined in the
[Data Types](#data-types) section.

The byte representation of a value `x` is defined as `byte(x)`.

The endianness is little and big-endian. Data types that are specific to
elliptic curve arithmetic (`POINT`, `SCALAR`, `ED448-PUBKEY`,
`ED448-SHARED-PREKEY` and `EDDSA-SIG`) are encoded as little-endian. The rest of
data types are encoded as big-endian. Little-endian encoding into bits places
bits from left to right and from least significant to most significant.
Big-endian encoding into bits places bits from right to left and from most
significant to least significant.

### Elliptic Curve Parameters

OTRv4 uses the Ed448-Goldilocks [\[4\]](#references) elliptic curve

1. Check that `X` is not equal to the identity element (`I`).
1. Check that `X` lies on the curve: this can be done by checking that `x`
   and `y` are integers on the interval `[0, p - 1]`.
1. Check that `q * X = I`.

### Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters

For any 57 bytes random value chosen in `Z_q` used for an elliptic curve
operation (denoted `value`), hash it directly into a 57-byte large buffer `h` by
doing `h = SHAKE-256(value, 57)`.

To prevent small subgroup attacks, prune the buffer:

The two least significant bits of the first byte are cleared, all eight bits of
the last byte are cleared, and the highest bit of the second to last byte is
set.

Interpret this pruned buffer as the little-endian integer, forming a secret
scalar.

Take into account these operations when choosing random values for
the [Socialist Millionaires Protocol](#socialist-millionaires-protocol-smp) and
the [Ring Signature of Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication).

### 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman Parameters

For the Diffie-Hellman (DH) group computations, the group is the one defined in
RFC 3526 [\[6\]](#references) with a 3072-bit modulus (hex, big-endian):

```
Prime (dh_p):

```

Whenever you see an operation on a field element from this group, the operation
should be done modulo the prime `dh_p`.

#### Verifying that an integer is in the DH group

To verify that an integer (`x`) is on the group with a 3072-bit modulus:

1. Check that `x` is `>= g3` and `<= dh_p - g3`.
1. Compute `x ^ dh_q mod dh_p`. If `result == 1`, the integer is a valid element.
   Otherwise the integer is an invalid element.

### Key Derivation Function, Hash Function and MAC Function

The following functions are used:

```
  KDF(usage_ID || values, size) = SHAKE-256("OTRv4" || usage_ID || values, size)
  HWC(usage_ID || values, size) = SHAKE-256("OTRv4" || usage_ID || values, size)
  HCMAC(usage_ID || values, size) = SHAKE-256("OTRv4" || usage_ID || values, size)
```

The Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function used when generating a key. The
Hash with Context Function (HWC) is a function used to generate a hash. The Hash
with Context Message Authentication Code is a function used to generate a MAC.

The `size` first bytes of the SHAKE-256 output for input
`"OTRv4" || usage_ID || m` are returned for the three functions. Unlike SHAKE
standard, notice that the output size here is defined in bytes.


The only different KDF function used in this specification is the one used when
referring to RFC 8032. As defined in that document:

```
  SHAKE-256(x, y) = The 'y' first bytes of SHAKE-256 output for input 'x'
```

The following usageID variables are defined:

```
  * usage_fingerprint = 0x00
  * usage_third_brace_key = 0x01
  * usage_brace_key = 0x02
  * usage_shared_secret = 0x03
  * usage_SSID = 0x04
  * usage_auth_r_bob_client_profile = 0x05
  * usage_auth_r_alice_client_profile = 0x06
  * usage_auth_r_phi = 0x07
  * usage_auth_i_bob_client_profile = 0x08
  * usage_auth_i_alice_client_profile = 0x09
  * usage_auth_i_phi = 0x0A
  * usage_first_root_key = 0x0B
  * usage_tmp_key = 0x0C
  * usage_auth_MAC_key = 0x0D
  * usage_non_int_auth_bob_client_profile = 0x0E
  * usage_non_int_auth_alice_client_profile = 0x0F
  * usage_non_int_auth_phi = 0x10
  * usage_auth_MAC = 0x11
  * usage_root_key = 0x12
  * usage_chain_key = 0x13
  * usage_next_chain_key = 0x14
  * usage_message_key = 0x15
  * usage_MAC_key = 0x16
  * usage_extra_symm_key = 0x17
  * usage_authenticator = 0x18
  * usage_SMP_secret = 0x19
  * usage_auth = 0x1A
```

## Data Types

OTRv4 uses many of the data types already specified in OTRv3 specification:

```
Bytes (BYTE):
  1 byte unsigned value
Shorts (SHORT):
  2 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Ints (INT):
  4 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Multi-precision integers (MPI):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte unsigned value, big-endian
  (MPIs must use the minimum-length encoding; i.e. no leading 0x00 bytes.
   This is important when calculating public key fingerprints)
Opaque variable-length data (DATA):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte data
```

OTRv4 also uses the following data types:

```
Nonce (NONCE):
  12 bytes data

Message Authentication Code (MAC):
  64 bytes MAC data

Ed448 point (POINT):
  57 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

Ed448 scalar (SCALAR):
  57 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

Client Profile (CLIENT-PROF):
  Detailed in "Client Profile Data Type" section

Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF)
  Detailed in "Prekey Profile Data Type" section
```

In order to encode a point or a scalar into `POINT` or `SCALAR` data types, and
to decode a `POINT` or `SCALAR` data types into a point or a scalar, refer to
the [Encoding and Decoding](#encoding-and-decoding) section.

### Encoding and Decoding

This section describes the encoding and decoding schemes specified in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references) for scalars and points. Note that, although the RFC 8032
defines parameters as octet strings, they are defined as bytes here. It also
describes the encoding of the OTRv4 messages that should be transmitted encoded.

#### Scalar

Encoded as a little-endian array of 57 bytes, e.g.
`h[0] + 2^8 * h[1] + ... + 2^447 * h[56]`.
Take into account that scalars used for public key generation are not sent
over the wire. Any random value chosen in `Z_q` that is going to be encoded,
should have been hashed and pruned as defined in the
[Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
section.

It is decoded to by interpreting a byte array (buffer) as an unsigned value,
little-endian, and doing `mod q` with the result. Note that every time a
`mod q` is specified for decoding, it is referred to this decoding.

#### Point

A curve point `(x,y)`, with coordinates in the range `0 <= x,y < p`, is
encoded as follows:

1. Encode the y-coordinate as a little-endian array of 57 bytes. The final byte
   is always zero.
1. Copy the least significant bit of the x-coordinate to the most significant
   bit of the final byte. This is `1` if the x-coordinate is negative or `0`
   if it is not.

A curve point is decoded as follows:

1. Interpret the 57-byte array as an integer in little-endian representation.
1. Interpret bit 455 as the least significant bit of the x-coordinate. Denote
   this value `x_0`.  The y-coordinate is recovered simply by clearing this bit.
   If the resulting value is `>= p`, decoding fails.
1. To recover the x-coordinate, the curve equation implies
   `x^2 = (y^2 - 1) / (d * y^2 - 1) (mod p)`. The denominator is always non-zero
   mod `p`.
   1. Let `num = y^2 - 1` and `denom = d * y^2 - 1`. To compute the square root
      of `(num/denom)`, compute the candidate root `x = (num/denom)^((p+1)/4)`.
      This can be done using a single modular powering for both the
      inversion of `denom` and the square root:

      ```
        x = ((num ^ 3) * denom * (num^5 * denom^3) ^ ((p-3)/4)) (mod p)
      ```

   1.  If `denom * x^2 = num`, the recovered x-coordinate is `x`. Otherwise, no
       square root exists, and decoding fails.
1. Use the `x_0` bit to select the right square root:
   * If `x = 0`, and `x_0 = 1`:
     * Decoding fails.
   * Otherwise, if `x_0 != x mod 2`:
     * Set `x <-- p - x`.
     * Return the decoded point `(x,y)`.

#### Encoded Messages

OTRv4 messages must be base-64 encoded. To transmit one of these messages,
construct an ASCII string: the five bytes "?OTR:", the base-64 encoding of the
binary form of the message and the byte ".".

### Serializing the Ring Signature Proof of Authentication

The Ring Signature's non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of authentication is
serialized as follows:

```
Ring Signature Authentication (RING-SIG):
  c1 (SCALAR)
  r1 (SCALAR)
  c2 (SCALAR)
  r2 (SCALAR)
  c3 (SCALAR)
  r3 (SCALAR)
```

### Public keys, Shared Prekeys, Forging keys and Fingerprints

OTR users have long-lived public keys that they use for authentication (but not 
for encryption). OTRv4 introduces a new type of this long-term public key:

```
OTRv4 public authentication Ed448 key (ED448-PUBKEY):

  Pubkey type
    2 byte unsigned value, little-endian
    Ed448 public keys have type 0x0010

  H (POINT)
    H is the Ed448 public key generated as defined in RFC 8032.
```

In addition, OTRv4 also has a long-lived forging key, used for online
deniability purposes and to somewhat protect against KCI attacks. Refer to
section [KCI attacks](#kci-attacks) for an explanation . This long-lived key is
serialized as follows:

```
OTRv4 public Ed448 forging key (ED448-FORGING-KEY):

  Pubkey type
    2 byte unsigned value, little-endian
    Ed448 public keys have type 0x0012

  F (POINT)
    F is the Ed448 public key generated as defined in RFC 8032, or directly
    as a random point.
```

The OTRv4 public shared prekey is defined as follows:

```
OTRv4 public shared prekey (ED448-SHARED-PREKEY):

  Shared Prekey type
    2 byte unsigned value, little-endian
    Ed448 shared prekeys have type 0x0011

  D (POINT)
    D is the Ed448 shared prekey generated the same way as the public key in
    RFC 8032.
```

The public key and shared prekey are generated as follows (refer to
RFC 8032 [\[9\]](#references), for more information on key generation). Note
that, although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are
defined as bytes here:

```
The symmetric key (sym_key) is 57 bytes of cryptographically secure random data.
If the symmetric key is used for the generation of 'ED448-PUBKEY', it is
denoted 'sym_h' If it is used for the generation of 'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY', it
is denoted 'sym_d'.

1. Hash the 'sym_key' using 'SHAKE-256(sym_key, 114)'. Store the digest in a
   114-byte buffer. Only the lower 57 bytes (denoted 'h') are used for
   generating the public key.
2. Prune the buffer 'h': the two least significant bits of the first
   byte are cleared, all eight bits of the last byte are cleared, and the
   highest bit of the second to last byte is set.
3. Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming the
   secret scalar 'sk'.  Perform a known-base-point scalar multiplication
   'sk * Base point (G)'. If the result is for the 'ED448-PUBKEY', store it in
   'H', encoded as POINT. If the result is for the 'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY',
   store it in 'D', encoded as POINT.
4. Securely store 'sk' locally, as 'sk_h' for 'ED448-PUBKEY', and 'sk_d' for
   'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY'. These keys will be stored for as long as the
   'ED448-PUBKEY' and the 'ED448-SHARED-PREKEY'  respectevely live.
   Additionally, securely store 'sym_key'. This key will be used for the Client
   and Prekey profiles signature. After their public key counterpart expires,
   they should be securely deleted or replaced.
5. Securely delete 'h'.
```

The forging keypair can be generated in one of two different ways - either by
generating the key as detailed above (by using scalar multiplication), just
like the 'honest' long lived Ed448 keys, or by directly generating a point on
the curve (the long-term public key) without its corresponding secret, as
detailed below. An implementation that uses the OTRv4 protocol must always
implement the forging keys. It should ask users whether or not they would like
to save the secret part of the forging keys (even if it was generated only
as a point in the curve without a secret key counterpart). Even if most users
select the default option to securely erase the forging keys, thereby preventing
them from performing online forgery techniques, someone watching the protocol
does not generally know the choice of the particular user. Consequently, someone
that engages in a conversation using a compromised device is given two
explanations: either the conversation is genuine, or the owner of the device is
one of the users that elected to store the forgery keys and they are using those
keys to forge the conversation. The result is that online deniability is
preserved, while preventing KCI attacks.

In order to generate the forging key as a point directly on the curve:

either:

1. Generate 57 bytes of cryptographically secure random data (`buf`).
2. Deserialize `buf` into a POINT.
3. Check whether it is a valid point. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.

or:

1. Use the Elligator technique [\[15\]](#references) by mapping a string to
   valid Ed448 curve point.

Public keys (Ed448 public key) and forging keys (Ed448 public forging key) have
fingerprints, which are hex strings that serve as identifiers. The full OTRv4
public key fingerprint is calculated by taking the SHAKE-256 hash of the
byte-level representation of the public key and the byte-level representation of
the forging public key. To authenticate the long-term key pairs, the
[Socialist Millionaire's Protocol](#socialist-millionaires-protocol-smp) or a
manual fingerprint comparison may be used. The fingerprint is generated as:

* `HWC(usage_fingerprint || byte(H) || byte(F), 56)` (224-bit security level).

### Instance Tags

Clients include instance tags in all OTRv4 messages. Instance tags are 4-byte
values that are intended to be persistent. If the same client is logged into the
same account from multiple locations/clients, the intention is that the client
will have different instance tags at each location/client. OTRv4 messages
(fragmented and unfragmented) include the source and destination instance tags.
If a client receives a message that lists a destination instance tag different
from its own, the client should discard the message.

The smallest valid instance tag is `0x00000100`. It is appropriate to set the
destination instance tag to `0` when an actual destination instance tag is not
known at the time the message is prepared. If a client receives a message with
the sender instance tag set to less than `0x00000100`, it should discard the
message. Similarly, if a client receives a message with the recipient instance
tag set to greater than `0` but less than `0x00000100`, it should discard the
message.

This practice avoids an issue on IM networks that always relay all messages to
all sessions of a client who is logged in multiple times. In this situation, OTR
clients can attempt to establish an OTR session indefinitely if there are
interleaving messages from each of the sessions.

### TLV Record Types

Each TLV record is of the form:

```
Type (SHORT)
  The type of this record. Records with unrecognized types should be ignored
Length (SHORT)
  The length of the following field
Value (len BYTE) [where len is the value of the Length field]
  Any pertinent data for the record type
```

OTRv4 supports some TLV record types from OTRv3. The supported types are:

```
Type 0: Padding
  The value may be an arbitrary amount of data. This data should be ignored.
  This type can be used to disguise the length of a plaintext message.

Type 1: Disconnected
  If the participant requests to close the private connection, you may send a
  message (possibly with empty human-readable part) containing a record with
  this TLV type just before you discard the session keys, and transition to
  'START' state (see below). If you receive a TLV record of this type, you
  should transition to 'FINISHED' state (see below), and inform the participant
  that its correspondent has closed its end of the private connection, and the
  participant should do the same. Old mac keys can be attached to this TLV when
  the session is expired. This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 2: SMP Message 1
  The value represents the initial message of the Socialist Millionaires'
  Protocol (SMP). Note that this represents TLV type 2 and 7 from OTRv3.
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 3: SMP Message 2
  The value represents the second message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 4: SMP Message 3
  The value represents the third message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 5: SMP Message 4
  The value represents the final message in an instance of the SMP. This TLV
  should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 6: SMP Abort Message
  If the participant cancels the SMP prematurely or encounters an error in the
  protocol and cannot continue, you may send a message (possibly with an empty
  human-readable part) with this TLV type to instruct the other party's client
  to abort the protocol. The associated length should be zero and the
  associated value should be empty. If you receive a TLV of this type, you
  should change the SMP state to 'SMPSTATE_EXPECT1' (see below, in SMP section).
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.

Type 7: Extra symmetric key
  If you wish to use the extra symmetric key, compute it yourself as outlined
  in the section "Extra symmetric key". Then send this type 7 TLV to your peer
  to indicate that you'd like to use the extra symmetric key for something. The
  value of the TLV begins with a 4-byte indication of what this symmetric key
  will be used for (file transfer, voice encryption, etc). After that, the
  contents are use-specific (which file, etc): there are no predefined uses.
  Note that the value of the key itself is not placed into the TLV, your peer
  will compute it on its own. This TLV represents TLV type 8 from OTRv3.
  This TLV should have the 'IGNORE_UNREADABLE' flag set.
```

If you receive a data message with a corrupted TLV (an incomplete one or a TLV
not included on this list), stop processing it, but process the remaining data
message and any other TLVs included in it.

### Shared Session State

Both the interactive and non-interactive DAKEs must authenticate their contexts
to prevent attacks that rebind the DAKE transcript into different contexts. If
the higher-level protocol ascribes some property to the connection, the DAKE
exchange should verify this property, so both sides of a conversation can
cryptographically verify some beliefs they have about the session.

A session is created when a new OTRv4 conversation begins. Given a shared
session state information `phi` (e.g., a session identifier) associated with the
higher-level context (e.g., XMPP), the DAKE authenticates that both parties
share the same value for `phi` (Φ).

The shared session state (Φ) verifies shared state from the higher-level
protocol as well as from OTR itself. Therefore, an implementer (who has complete
knowledge of the application network stack) should define a known shared session
state from the higher-level protocol as `phi'`, as well as include the values
imposed by this specification.

Note that variable length fields are encoded as DATA. If `phi'` is a string, it
will be encoded in UTF-8.

To make sure both participants has the same phi during DAKE, sort the instance
tag by numerical order and any string passed to `phi'` lexicographically.

```
  session identifier mandated by the OTRv4 spec = sender and receiver's instance
    tags, first ephemeral keys for the double ratchet initialization
  phi' = session identifier defined by the implementer
  phi = session identifier mandated by the OTRv4 spec || phi'
```

In XMPP, for example, `phi'` can be the node and domain parts of the sender and
receiver's jabber identifier, e.g. `alice@jabber.net` (often referred as the
"bare JID"). In an application that assigns some attribute to users before a
conversation (e.g., a networked game in which players take on specific roles),
the expected attributes (expressed in fixed length) should be included in
`phi'`. A static password shared by both sides can also be included.

For example, a shared session state which higher-level protocol is XMPP, will
look like:

```
  phi = sender's instance tag || receiver's instance tag || our_ecdh_first ||
        our_dh_first || their_ecdh_first || their_dh_first ||
        DATA(sender's bare JID) || DATA(receiver's bare JID)
  phi = 0x00000100 || 0x00000101 || 0x57 || 0x164 || 0x57 || 0x164 ||
        DATA("alice@jabber.net") || DATA("bob@jabber.net")
```

### Secure Session ID

The secure session ID (`SSID`) is a 8-byte value. If the participant requests
to see it, it should be displayed as two 4-byte big-endian unsigned values. For
example, in C language, in "%08x" format. If the party transmitted the Auth-R
message during the DAKE, then display the first 4 bytes in bold, and the second
4 bytes in non-bold. If the party transmitted the Auth-I message instead,
display the first 4 bytes in non-bold, and the second 4 bytes in bold. If the
party transmitted the Non-Interactive-Auth message during the DAKE, then display
the first 4 bytes in bold, and the second 4 bytes in non-bold. If the party
received the Non-Interactive-Auth message instead, display the first 4 bytes
in non-bold, and the second 4 bytes in bold.

This Secure Session ID can be used by the parties to verify (over the telephone,
assuming the parties recognize each others' voices) that there is no
man-in-the-middle by having each side read his bold part to the other. Note that
this only needs to be done in the event that the participants do not trust that
their long-term keys have not been compromised.

### OTR Error Messages

Any message containing "?OTR Error: " at the starting position is an OTR Error
Message. The following part of the message should contain human-readable details
of the error. The message may also include a specific code at the beginning,
e.g. "?OTR Error: ERROR_N: ". This code is used to identify which error is being
received for optional localization of the message.

Currently, the following errors are supported:

```
  ERROR_1: (the message is undecryptable)
    Unreadable message
  ERROR_2: (the message arrived in a state that is not encrypted messages)
    Not in private state message
  ERROR_3: (the instance tags do not correspond)
    Malformed message
```
Note that the string "?OTR Error:" must be in at the start position of the
message because of these reasons:

- The possibility for playing games with the state machine by "embedding" this
  string inside some other message.
- The potential of social engineering depending on the UI of the used chat
  client.

## Key Management

In both the interactive and non-interactive DAKEs, OTRv4 uses long-term Ed448
keys, ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keys, and ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys.

For exchanging data messages, OTRv4 uses KDF chains: the symmetric-key ratchet
and the DH ratchet (with ECDH) from the Double Ratchet algorithm
[\[2\]](#references). OTRv4 adds 3072-bit (384-byte) DH keys, called the brace
key pair, to the Double Ratchet algorithm. These keys are used to protect
transcripts of data messages in case ECC is broken. During the DAKE and
initialization of the Double Ratchet Algorithm, both parties agree upon the
first set of ECDH and DH keys. Then, during every third DH ratchet in the Double
Ratchet, a new DH key is agreed upon. Between each DH brace key ratchet, both
sides will conduct a symmetric brace key ratchet.

The following variables keep state as the ratchet moves forward:

```
State variables:
  i: the ratchet id.
  max_remote_i_seen: the maximum 'i' seen from the other participant.
  j: the sending message id.
  k: the receiving message id.
  pn: the number of messages in the previous DH ratchet.
  since_last_dh: a variable that keeps track of the last time a DH key was
                 generated.

Key variables:
  'root_key': the root key. If it is 'prev_root_key', it refers to the previous
              generated root key. If it is 'curr_root_key', it refers to the
              current root key.
  'chain_key_s[j]': the sending chain key for the sending message 'j'.
  'chain_key_r[k]': the receiving chain key for the receiving message 'k'.
  'our_ecdh': our current ECDH ephemeral key pair.
  'their_ecdh': their ECDH ephemeral public key.
  'our_dh': our DH ephemeral key pair.
  'their_dh': their DH ephemeral public key.
  'brace_key': either a hash of the shared DH key: 'KDF(usage_third_brace_key ||
   k_dh, 32)' (every third DH ratchet) or a hash of the previous 'brace_key:
   KDF(usage_brace_key || brace_key, 32)'
  'mac_keys_to_reveal': the MAC keys to be revealed in the first data message
    sent of the next ratchet.
  'skipped_MKenc': Dictionary of stored skipped-over message keys, indexed by
    'their_ecdh' and the message number ('j'). Raises and exception if too many
    elements are stored.
  'max_skip' a constant that specifies the maximum number of message keys
    that can be skipped in a ratchet. It should be set by the implementer. Take
    into account that it should be set high enough to tolerate routine lost or
    delayed messages, but low enough that a malicious sender can't trigger
    excessive recipient computation.
```

Depending on the event, the state variables are incremented and some key
variable values are replaced:

* When you start a new [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by sending
  or receiving an [Identity Message](#identity-message).
* When you complete the [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by
  sending an [Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message).
* When you complete the [Interactive DAKE](#interactive-dake-overview) by
  receiving and validating an [Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message).
* When you start a new [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  publishing or retrieving a Prekey Ensemble.
* When you complete a [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  sending a [Non-interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
* When you complete a [Non-interactive DAKE](#non-interactive-dake-overview) by
  receiving and validating a
  [Non-interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
* When you [send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) or
  [receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message).
* When you [send a TLV type 1 (Disconnected)](#sending-a-tlv-type-1-disconnected-message).

### Generating ECDH and DH keys

```
generateECDH()
  - pick a random value r (57 bytes)
  - Hash the 'r' using 'SHAKE-256(r, 114)'. Store the digest in a
    114-byte buffer. Only the lower 57 bytes (denoted 'h') are used for
    generating the public key.
  - prune 'h': the two least significant bits of the first byte are cleared, all
    eight bits of the last byte are cleared, and the highest bit of the second
    to last byte is set.
  - Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming the secret scalar
    's'.
  - Securely delete 'r' and 'h'.
  - return our_ecdh.public = G * s, our_ecdh.secret = s

generateDH()
  - pick a random value r (80 bytes)
  - return our_dh.public = g3 ^ r, our_dh.secret = r
```

### Shared Secrets

```
k_dh:
  The 3072-bit DH shared secret computed from a DH exchange, serialized as a
  big-endian unsigned integer.

brace_key:
  Either a hash of the shared DH key: 'KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)'
  (every third DH ratchet) or a hash of the previous:
  'brace_key: KDF(usage_brace_key || brace_key, 32)'.

K_ecdh:
  The serialized ECDH shared secret computed from an ECDH exchange, serialized
  as a 'POINT'.

K:
  The Mixed shared secret is the final shared secret derived from both the
  brace key and ECDH shared secrets:
  'KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)'.
```

### Generating Shared Secrets

```
ECDH(a, B)
  K_ecdh = a * B
  if K_ecdh == 0 (check that it is an all-zero value)
     return error
  else
     return K_ecdh
```

Check, without leaking extra information about the value of `K_ecdh`, whether
`K_ecdh` is the all-zero value and abort if so, as this process involves
contributory behavior. Contributory behaviour means that both parties' private
keys contribute to the resulting shared key. Since Ed448 have a cofactor of 4,
an input point of small order will eliminate any contribution from the other
party's private key. This situation can be detected by checking for the all-zero
output.

```
DH(a, B)
  return k_dh = a ^ B
```

### Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as sender

Before sending the first reply (i.e. a new message considering a previous
message has been received) or sending the first data message, the sender will
rotate their ECDH keys and their brace key. This is for the computation of the
Mixed shared secret `K` (see
[Deriving Double Ratchet Keys](#deriving-double-ratchet-keys)).

Before rotating the keys:

  * Reset the sending message id (`j`) to 0.

To rotate the ECDH keys:

  * Generate a new ECDH key pair and assign it to `our_ecdh = generateECDH()`
    (by securely replacing the old value).
  * Calculate `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
  * `i = i + 1`

To rotate the brace key:

  * If `since_last_dh == 3`:

    * Generate the new DH key pair and assign it to `our_dh = generateDH()`
      (by securely replacing the old value).
    * Calculate `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
    * Calculate a `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
    * Securely delete `k_dh`.
    * Set `since_last_dh` to 0.

  * Otherwise:

    * Derive and securely overwrite
      `brace_key = KDF(usage_brace_key || brace_key, 32)`.
    * Increase `since_last_dh` by 1.

### Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as receiver

Every ratchet, the receiver will rotate their ECDH keys and their brace key.
This is for the computation of the Mixed shared secret `K` (see
[Deriving Double Ratchet Keys](#deriving-double-ratchet-keys)).

Before rotating the keys:

  * Reset the receiving message id (`k`) to 0.

To rotate the ECDH keys:

  * Retrieve the ECDH key ('Public ECDH key') from the received data message and
    assign it to `their_ecdh`.
  * Calculate `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
  * Securely delete `our_ecdh.secret`.

To rotate the brace key:

  * If `since_last_dh == 3`:

    * Retrieve the DH key ('Public DH key') from the received data message and
      assign it to `their_dh`.
    * Calculate `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
    * Calculate a `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
    * Securely delete `our_dh.secret` and `k_dh`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Derive and securely overwrite
      `brace_key = KDF(usage_brace_key || brace_key, 32)`.
    * Increase `since_last_dh` by 1.

### Deriving Double Ratchet Keys

To derive the next root key and the current chain key:

Note that if there is no previous root key (because this is the first ratchet),
then keys are derived from the previous Mixed shared secret `K` (interpreted
as `prev_root_key`) and the current Mixed shared secret `K`.

Depending if this is used to derive sending or receiving chain keys, the
variable `i` should refer to `j` (for sending) and `k` (for receiving).

```
derive_ratchet_keys(purpose, prev_root_key, K):
  curr_root_key = KDF(usage_root_key || prev_root_key || K, 64)
  chain_key_purpose[i] = KDF(usage_chain_key || prev_root_key || K, 64)
  return curr_root_key, chain_key_purpose[i]
```

### Calculating Encryption and MAC Keys

When sending or receiving data messages, you must calculate the message keys:

```
derive_enc_mac_keys(chain_key):
  MKenc = KDF(usage_message_key || chain_key, 64)
  MKmac = KDF(usage_MAC_key || MKenc, 64)
  return MKenc, MKmac
```

### Resetting State Variables and Key Variables

The state variables are set to `0` and the key variables are set to `NULL`.

### Session Expiration

OTRv4 can be vulnerable to a situation when an attacker capture some messages to
compromise their ephemeral secrets at a later time. To mitigate against this,
message keys should be deleted regularly. OTRv4 implements this by detecting
whether a new ECDH key has been generated within a certain amount of time. If it
hasn't, the session is expired.

To expire a session:

1. Calculate the MAC keys corresponding to the stored message keys in the
   `skipped_MKenc` dictionary and put them on the `old_mac_keys` list (so they
   are revealed in TLV type 1 (Disconnected) message).
1. Send a Data message containing a TLV type 1 with empty payload - this is
   often referred to as 'Disconnected message' - with the `old_mac_keys` list
   attached to it.
1. Securely delete all keys and data associated with the conversation.
   This includes:

   1. The root key and all chain keys.
   1. All message keys and extra symmetric keys stored in the `skipped_MKenc`
      dictionary.
   1. The ECDH keys, DH keys and brace keys.
   1. The Secure Session ID (SSID) whose creation is described
      [here](#interactive-deniable-authenticated-key-exchange-dake)
      and [here](#non-interactive-auth-message),
      any old MAC keys that remain unrevealed, and the
      extra symmetric key if present.
   1. Reset the state and key variables, as defined in
      [its section](#resetting-state-variables-and-key-variables).

1. Transition the protocol state machine to `FINISHED` state.

The session expiration time is decided individually by each party so it is
possible for one person to have an expiration time of two hours and the other
party have it of two weeks. The client implementer should decide what the
appropriate expiration time is for their particular circumstance.

The session expiration encourages keys to be deleted often at the cost of
having lost messages whose MAC keys cannot be revealed. For example, if Alice
sets her session expiration time to be 2 hours, in order to reset Alice's
session expiration timer, Bob must create a reply and Alice must create a
response to this reply. If this does not happen within two hours, Alice will
expire her session and delete all keys associated with this conversation. If
she receives a message from Bob after two hours, she will not be able to decrypt
the message and thus she will not reveal the MAC key associated with it. Note,
nevertheless, that the MAC keys corresponding to stored message keys (from
messages that have not yet arrived) will be derived and revealed in the TLV
type 1 that is sent.

It is also possible for the heartbeat messages to keep a session from expiring.
Sticking with the above example of Alice's 2 hour session expiration time, Bob
or Bob's client may send a heartbeat message every minute. In addition, Alice's
client may send a heartbeat every five minutes. Thus, as long as both Bob and
Alice's clients are online and sending heartbeat messages, Alice's session will
not expire. But if Bob's client turns off or goes offline for at least two
hours, Alice's session will expire.

The session expiration timer begins at different times for the sender and the
receiver of the first data message in a conversation. The sender begins their
timer as they send the first data message or as they attach an encrypted
message to the Non-Interactive-Auth message. The receiver begins their timer
when they receive this first data message.

Since the session expiration uses a timer, it can be compromised by clock
errors. Some errors may cause the session to be deleted too early and result in
undecryptable messages being received. Other errors may result in the clock not
moving forward which would cause a session to never expire. To mitigate this,
implementers should use secure and reliable clocks that can't be manipulated by
an attacker.

## Client Profile

OTRv4 introduces Client Profiles. A Client Profile has an arbitrary number of
fields, but some fields are required. A Client Profile contains the Client
Profile owner instance tag, an Ed448 long-term public key, the Ed448 long-term
forging public key, information about supported versions, a profile expiration
date, a signature of all these, and an optional transitional signature.
Therefore, the Client Profile has variable length.

There are two instances of the Client Profile that should be generated. One is
used for authentication in both DAKEs (interactive and non-interactive). The
other should be published in a public place. This allows two parties to send and
verify each other's Client Profiles during the DAKEs without damaging
the deniability properties for the conversation, since the Client Profile is
public information. A Client Profile is also published so it is easier to revoke
any past value that could have been advertised on a previous Client Profile, to
to prevent "version" rollback attacks, and to start offline conversations.

Each implementation should decide how to publish the Client Profile. For
example, one client may publish profiles to a server pool (similar to a
keyserver pool, where PGP public keys can be published). Another client may use
XMPP's publish-subscribe extension (XEP-0060 [\[8\]](#references)) for
publishing Client Profiles. For sending offline messages, notice that the Client
Profile has to be published and stored in the same untrusted Prekey Server used
to store Prekey Messages and Prekey Profiles, so the Prekey Ensemble can be
assembled.

A Client Profile has an expiration time as this helps to revoke any past value
stated in a previous profile. If a user's client, for example, changes its
long-term public key, only the valid non-expired Client Profile is the one used
for attesting that this is indeed the valid long-term public key. Any expired
Client Profiles with old long-term public keys are invalid. Moreover, as
version advertisement is public information (it is stated in the published
Client Profile), a participant will not be able to delete this information from
public servers (if the Client Profile is published in them). To facilitate
version revocation or any of the other values revocation, the Client Profile
can be regenerated and republished once the older Client Profile expires. This
is also the reason why we recommend a short expiration date, so values can be
easily revoked.

Before the Client Profile expires, it should be updated. Client implementations
should determine the frequency of the Client Profile expiration and renewal.
The recommended expiration time is one week.

Nevertheless, for a short amount of time (decided by the client) a Client
Profile can still be locally used even if it has publicly expired. This is
needed for non-interactive conversations as a party, Alice, can send
offline encrypted messages using a non-expired published Client Profile from
Bob. This Client Profile, nevertheless, can expire prior to the moment in which
the other party, Bob, receives the offline encrypted messages. To allow this
party, Bob, to still be able to validate and decrypt these messages, the Client
Profile can still be locally used even if it has publicly expired. A recommended
amount of time for this extra validity time is of 1 day.

It is also important to note that the absence of a Client Profile is not a proof
that a user does not support OTRv4.

Notice that the valid lifetime of the long-term public key and forging public
key is exactly the same as the lifetime of the Client Profile. If you have no
valid Client Profile available for a specific long-term public key or for a
specific forging public key, that long-term public key or forging public key
should be treated as invalid. This also implies that a long term public key or
forging public key can go from being valid to invalid, and back to valid.
Notice, nevertheless, that long-term public keys and forging public keys can
live longer than a Client Profile. A long-term public keys or forging public key
does not need to be generated every time a Client Profile is renewed. But a
long-term public key or a forging public key is only valid for the amount of
time a Client Profile (that has them) is valid.

A Client Profile also includes an instance tag. This value is used for locally
storing and retrieving the Client Profile during the non-interactive DAKE. This
instance tag has to match the sender instance tag of the DAKE message the Client
Profile is included in.

Note that a Client Profile is generated per client basis. Users are not expected
to manage Client Profiles (theirs or from others) in a client. As a consequence,
clients are discouraged to allow importing or exporting of Client Profiles.
Also, if a user has multiple client locations concurrently in use, it is
expected that they have multiple Client Profiles simultaneously published and
valid.

A Client Profile can be used to prevent rollback attacks. As a query message can
be intercepted and changed by a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) to enforce the lowest
version advertised, a participant can check for the published Client Profile to
see if this is indeed the highest supported version.

### Client Profile Data Type

```
Client Profile (CLIENT-PROF):
  Number of Fields (INT)
  Fields (SEQ-FIELDS)
    2 byte unsigned type, big-endian
    the encoded field
  Client Profile Signature (CLIENT-EDDSA-SIG)
```

The supported fields should not be duplicated. They are:

```
Client Profile owner instance tag (INT)
  Type = 0x0001
  The instance tag of the client/device that created the Client Profile.

Ed448 public key (ED448-PUBKEY)
  Type = 0x0002
  Corresponds to 'OTRv4 public authentication Ed448 key'.

Ed448 public forging key (ED448-FORGING-KEY)
  Type = 0x0003
  Corresponds to 'OTRv4 public Ed448 forging key'.

Versions (DATA)
  Type = 0x0004

Client Profile Expiration (CLIENT-PROF-EXP)
  Type = 0x0005

OTRv3 public authentication DSA key (PUBKEY)
  Type = 0x0006

Transitional Signature (CLIENT-SIG)
  Type = 0x0007
  This signature is defined as a signature over fields 0x0001,
  0x0002, 0x0003, 0x0004, 0x0005 and 0x0006 only.
```

Note that the Client Profile Expiration is encoded as:

```
Client Profile Expiration (CLIENT-PROF-EXP):
  8 bytes signed value, big-endian
```

`CLIENT-EDDSA-SIG` refers to the OTRv4 EDDSA signature:

```
EDDSA signature (CLIENT-EDDSA-SIG):
  (len is the expected length of the signature, which is 114 bytes)
  len byte unsigned value, little-endian
```

`CLIENT-SIG` is the DSA Signature. It is the same signature as used in OTRv3.
From the OTRv3 protocol, section "Public keys, signatures, and fingerprints",
the format for a signature generated with the OTRv3 DSA public key is as
follows:

```
DSA signature (CLIENT-SIG):
  (len is the length of the DSA public parameter q, which in current
  implementations is 20 bytes)
  len byte unsigned r, big-endian
  len byte unsigned s, big-endian
```

If version 3 and 4 are supported, the OTRv3 DSA public key must be included in
the Client Profile. As defined in OTRv3 spec, the OTRv3 DSA public key is
defined as:

```
OTRv3 public authentication DSA key (PUBKEY):
  Pubkey type (SHORT)
    DSA public keys have type 0x0000
  p (MPI)
  q (MPI)
  g (MPI)
  y (MPI)
(p,q,g,y) are the OTRv3 DSA public key parameters
```

### Creating a Client Profile

To create a Client Profile, generate:

1. A 4-byte instance tag to use as the Client Profile owner instance tag. This
   should only be done if the client doesn't already have an instance tag for
   this user.

Then, assemble:

1. Client Profile owner instance tag.
1. Ed448 long-term public key.
1. Ed448 long-term public forging key.
1. Versions: a string corresponding to the user's supported OTR versions.
   A Client Profile can advertise multiple OTR versions. The format is described
   under the section [Establishing Versions](#establishing-versions) below.
1. Client Profile Expiration: Expiration date in standard Unix 64-bit format
   (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring leap
   seconds).
1. OTRv3 public authentication DSA key (optional): The OTRv3 long-term public
   key. It should be included if version 3 and 4 are supported.
1. Transitional Signature (optional): A signature of the Client Profile
   excluding the Client Profile Signature and the user's OTRv3 DSA key. The
   Transitional Signature enables parties that trust user's version 3 DSA key
   to trust the Client Profile in version 4. This is only used if the user
   supports versions 3 and 4. For more information, refer to
   [Create a Client Profile Signature](#create-a-client-profile-signature)
   section. The presence of OTRv3 public authentication DSA key means that the
   Transitional signature is mandatory. But the user can decide to have a
   Transitional signature without publish the OTRv3 public authentication DSA
   key on the Client Profile.

Then:

1. Assemble the previous fields as `Fields`.
1. Assign the number of `Fields` as `Number of Fields`.
1. Generate the Client Profile signature: The symmetric key, the flag `f` (set
   to zero, as defined on RFC 8032 [\[9\]](#references)) and the empty
   context `c` are used to create a signature of the entire Client Profile
   excluding the signature itself. The size of the signature is 114 bytes. For
   its generation, refer to
   [Create a Client Profile Signature](#create-a-client-profile-signature)
   section.

After the Client Profile is created, it must be published in a public untrusted
place. When using OTRv4 in OTRv3-compatible mode and OTRv4-standalone mode,
notice that the Client Profile has to be published and stored in the untrusted
Prekey Server used to store prekey messages and Prekey Profiles.

### Establishing Versions

A valid version string can be created by concatenating supported version
numbers together in any order. For example, a user who supports versions 3 and 4
will have the 2-byte version string "43" or "34" in their Client Profile. A user
who only supports version 4 will have the 1-byte version string "4". Thus, a
version string has varying size, and it is represented as a DATA type with its
length specified.

A compliant OTRv4 implementation (in OTRv4-compatible mode) is required to
support version 3 of OTR, but not versions 1 and 2. Therefore, invalid version
strings contain a "2" or a "1".

Any other version string that is not "4", "3", "2", or "1" should be ignored.

### Client Profile Expiration and Renewal

If a renewed Client Profile is not published in a public place, the user's
deniability is at risk. Deniability is also at risk if the only publicly
available Client Profile is expired. For that reason, a received expired Client
Profile during the DAKE meeting that criteria is considered invalid.

Before the Client Profile expires, the user must publish an updated Client
Profile with a new expiration date. This expiration date is defined as the
number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.

The client establishes the frequency of expiration and when to publish (before
the  current Client Profile expires). Note that this can be configurable. A
recommended value is one week.

### Create a Client Profile Signature

If version 3 and 4 are supported and the user has a pre-existing OTRv3
long-term keypair:

   * Concatenate `Client Profile owner instance tag || Ed448 public key || Ed448
     public forging key || Versions || Client Profile Expiration || OTRv3 public
     authentication DSA key`. Denote this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the user's OTRv3 DSA key. Denote this value
     `Transitional Signature`.
   * Sign `m || Transitional Signature` with the symmetric key, as stated
     below. Denote this value `Client Profile Signature`.

Note that if you only have version 4 turned on (on a local policy) but still
support version 3 (you have a OTRv3 long-term keypair), you don't need to sign
the Client Profile with this key.

If only version 4 is supported:

   * Concatenate `Client Profile owner's instance tag || Ed448 public key ||
     Ed448 public forging key || Versions || Client Profile Expiration`. Denote
     this value `m`.
   * Sign `m` with the symmetric key, as stated below. Denote this value
     `Client Profile Signature`.

The Client Profile signature for version 4 is generated as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.6. The flag `f` is set to `0` and the context
`c` is an empty constant string.

Note that, although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are
defined as bytes here.

It is generated as follows:

```
The inputs are the symmetric key (57 bytes, defined in the 'Public keys and
fingerprints' section. It is referred as 'sym_key'), a flag 'f', which is a byte
with value 0, a context 'c' (a value set by the signer and verifier of maximum
255 bytes), which is an empty byte string for this protocol, and a message 'm'.
The function 'len(x)' should be interpreted here as the number of bytes in the
string 'x'.

1.  Hash the 'sym_key': 'SHAKE-256(sym_key, 114)'. Let 'h' denote the resulting
    digest. Construct the secret key 'sk' from the first half of 'h' (57 bytes),
    and the corresponding public key 'H', as defined in the 'Public keys, Shared
    Prekeys and Fingerprints' section. Let 'prefix' denote the second half of
    the 'h' (from 'h[57]' to 'h[113]').

2.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || byte(f) || byte(len(c)) || c || prefix ||
    m, 114)', where 'm' is the message to be signed. Let 'r' be the 114-byte
    resulting digest and interpret it as a little-endian integer.

3.  Multiply the scalar 'r' by the Base Point (G). For efficiency, do this by
    first reducing 'r' modulo 'q', the group order.  Let 'R' be the encoding
    of this resulting point. It should be encoded as a POINT.

4.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114)'.
    Interpret the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

5.  Compute 'S = (r + k * sk) mod q'.  For efficiency, reduce 'k' again modulo
    'q' first.

6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of 'R' (57 bytes) and the
    little-endian encoding of 'S' (57 bytes, the ten most significant bits are
    always zero).

7. Securely delete 'sk', 'h', 'r' and 'k'.
```

### Verify a Client Profile Signature

The Client Profile signature is verified as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.7. It works as follows:

```
1.  To verify a signature on a message 'm', using the public key 'H', with 'f'
    being 0, and 'c' being empty, split the signature into two 57-byte halves.
    Decode the first half as a point 'R', and the second half as a scalar
    'S'. Decode the public key 'H' as a point 'H_1'. If any of the
    decodings fail (including 'S' being out of range), the signature is invalid.

2.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || byte(f) || byte(len(c)) || c || R || H ||
    m, 114)'. Interpret the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

3.  Check the group equation '4 * (S * G) = (4 * R) + (4 * (k * H_1))'. It's is
    sufficient to check '(S * G) = R + (k * H_1)'.
```

### Validating a Client Profile

To validate a Client Profile, you must (in this order):

1. Verify that the `Client Profile Signature` field is not empty.
1. [Verify that the Client Profile signature is valid](#verify-a-client-profile-signature).
1. Verify that the Client Profile owner's instance tag is equal to the Sender
   Instance tag of the person that sent the DAKE message in which the Client
   Profile is received.
1. Verify that the Client Profile has not expired.
1. Verify that the `Versions` field contains the character "4".
1. Validate that `Ed448 Public Key` is on
   the curve Ed448-Goldilocks. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Validate that `Ed448 Public Forging Key` is on
   the curve Ed448-Goldilocks. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. If the `Transitional Signature` and OTRv3 DSA key are present and, verify
   their validity using the OTRv3 DSA key. This validation is optional.

## Prekey Profile

OTRv4 introduces prekey profiles. The Prekey Profile contains the Prekey Profile
owner's instance tag, a shared prekey, a prekey profile expiration date and a
signature of all these. It is signed by the Ed448 long-term public key.

A prekey profile is needed for it's signed shared prekey, which is used for
offline conversations. It is changed on a regular basis as defined by the
expiration date in it.

There are two instances of the Prekey Profile that should be generated. One is
used for publication in an untrusted prekey server, so parties can use it
to send offline messages. The other should be stored locally to be used in the
Non-Interactive DAKE. Notice that the Prekey Profile has to be published and
stored in the same untrusted Prekey Server used to store prekey messages. This
is needed in order to generate the Prekey Ensemble needed for non-interactive
conversations.

When the Prekey Profile expires, it should be updated. Client implementations
should determine the frequency of the prekey's profile expiration and renewal.
They should also determine when a new Prekey Profile is published (prior to
it been expired or just at moment it expires). The recommended expiration time
is one week.

Nevertheless, for a short amount of time (decided by the client) a Prekey
Profile can still be locally used even if it has publicly expired. This is
needed for non-interactive conversations as a party, Alice, can send
offline encrypted messages using a non-expired published Prekey Profile from
Bob. This Prekey Profile, nevertheless, can expire prior to the moment in which
the other party, Bob, receives the offline encrypted messages. To allow this
party, Bob, to still be able to validate and decrypt these messages, the Prekey
Profile can still be locally used even if it has publicly expired. A recommended
amount of time for this extra validity time is of 1 day.

Note that a Prekey Profile is generated per client location basis. Users
are not expected to manage prekey profiles (theirs or from others) in a client.
As a consequence, clients are discouraged to allow importing or exporting of
prekey profiles. Also, if a user has multiple client locations
concurrently in use, it is expected that they have multiple prekey profiles
simultaneously published and valid.

### Prekey Profile Data Type

```
Prekey Profile Expiration (PREKEY-PROF-EXP):
  8 byte signed value, big-endian

Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF):
  Prekey Profile owner's instance tag (INT)
    The instance tag of the client that created the Prekey Profile.
  Prekey Profile Expiration (PREKEY-PROF-EXP)
  Public Shared Prekey (ED448-SHARED-PREKEY)
    The shared prekey used between different prekey messages.
    Corresponds to 'D'.
  Prekey Profile Signature (PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG)
    Created with the Ed448 long-term public key.
```

Note that the Prekey Profile Expiration is encoded as:

```
Client Profile Expiration (PREKEY-PROF-EXP):
  8 bytes signed value, big-endian
```

`PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG` refers to the OTRv4 EDDSA signature:

```
PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG signature (PREKEY-EDDSA-SIG):
  (len is the expected length of the signature, which is 114 bytes)
  len byte unsigned value, little-endian
```

### Creating a Prekey Profile

To create a Prekey Profile, assemble:

1. The same Client Profile owner's instance tag. Denote this value Prekey
   Profile owner's instance tag.
1. Prekey Profile Expiration: Expiration date in standard Unix 64-bit format
   (seconds since the midnight starting Jan 1, 1970, UTC, ignoring leap
   seconds).
1. Public Shared Prekey: An Ed448 Public Key used in multiple prekey messages.
   It adds partial protection against an attacker that modifies the first flow
   of the non-interactive DAKE and that compromises the receivers long-term
   secret key and their one-time ephemeral keys. For its generation, refer to
   the [Public keys, Shared Prekeys, Forging keys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-forging-keys-and-fingerprints)
   section. This key must expire when the Prekey Profile expires.
1. Profile Signature: The symmetric key `sym_h`, the flag `f` (set to zero, as
   defined on RFC 8032 [\[9\]](#references)) and the empty context `c` are used
   to create signatures of the entire profile excluding the signature itself.
   The size of the signature is 114 bytes. For its generation, refer to the
   [Create a Prekey Profile Signature](#create-a-prekey-profile-signature)
   section.

After the Prekey Profile is created, it must be published in the untrusted
Prekey Server.

### Prekey Profile Expiration and Renewal

Before the prekey profile expires, the user must publish an updated prekey
profile with a new expiration date. This expiration date is defined as the
number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.

The client establishes the frequency of expiration and when to publish (before
the current Prekey Profile expires). Note that this can be configurable. A
recommended value is one week.

### Create a Prekey Profile Signature

For this:

* Concatenate `Prekey Profile's owner's instance tag ||
  Prekey Profile Expiration || Public Shared Prekey`. Denote this value `m`.
* Sign `m` with the symmetric key `sym_h`, as stated below. Denote this value
  `Profile Signature`.

The Prekey Profile signature for version 4 is generated as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.6. The flag `f` is set to `0` and the context
`c` is an empty constant string.

Note that, although the RFC 8032 defines parameters as octet strings, they are
defined as bytes here.

It is generated as follows:

```
The inputs are the symmetric key (57 bytes, defined in the 'Public keys and
fingerprints' section. It is referred as 'sym_key_h'), a flag 'f', which is a
byte with value 0, a context 'c' (a value set by the signer and verifier of
maximum 255 bytes), which is an empty byte string for this protocol, and a
message 'm'. The function 'len(x)' should be interpreted here as the number of
bytes in the string 'x'.

1.  Hash the 'sym_key_h': 'SHAKE-256(sym_key, 114)'. Let 'h' denote the
    resulting digest. Construct the secret key 'sk' from the first half of
    'h' (57 bytes), and the corresponding public key 'H', as defined in the
    'Public keys, Shared Prekeys, Forging keys and Fingerprints' section. Let
    'prefix' denote the second half of the 'h' (from 'h[57]' to 'h[113]').

2.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || byte(f) || byte(len(c)) || c || prefix ||
    m, 114)', where 'm' is the message to be signed. Let 'r' be the 114-byte
    resulting digest and interpret it as a little-endian integer.

3.  Multiply the scalar 'r' by the Base Point (G). For efficiency, do this by
    first reducing 'r' modulo 'q', the group order.  Let 'R' be the encoding
    of this resulting point. It should be encoded as a POINT.

4.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || f || len(c) || c || R || H || m, 114)'.
    Interpret the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

5.  Compute 'S = (r + k * sk) mod q'.  For efficiency, reduce 'k' again modulo
    'q' first.

6.  Form the signature of the concatenation of 'R' (57 bytes) and the
    little-endian encoding of 'S' (57 bytes, the ten most significant bits are
    always zero).

7. Securely delete 'sk', 'h', 'r' and 'k'.
```

### Verify a Prekey Profile Signature

The Prekey Profile signature is verified as defined in RFC 8032
[\[9\]](#references), section 5.2.7. It works as follows:

```
1.  To verify a signature on a message 'm', using the long-term public key 'H',
    with 'f' being 0, and 'c' being empty, split the signature into two 57-byte
    halves. Decode the first half as a point 'R', and the second half as a
    scalar 'S'. Decode the public key 'H' as a point 'H_1'. If any of the
    decodings fail (including 'S' being out of range), the signature is invalid.

2.  Compute 'SHAKE-256("SigEd448" || byte(f) || byte(len(c)) || c || R || H ||
    m, 114)'. Interpret the 114-byte digest as a little-endian integer 'k'.

3.  Check the group equation '4 * (S * G) = (4 * R) + (4 * (k * H_1))'. It's is
    sufficient to check '(S * G) = R + (k * H_1)'.
```

### Validating a Prekey Profile

To validate a Prekey Profile, you must (in this order):

1. [Verify that the Prekey Profile signature is valid](#verify-a-prekey-profile-signature).
1. Verify that the Prekey Profile owner's instance tag is equal to the Sender
   Instance tag of the person that sent the DAKE message in which the Prekey
   Profile is received.
1. Verify that the Prekey Profile has not expired.
1. Verify that the Prekey Profile owner's instance tag is equal to the Sender
   Instance tag of the person that sent the DAKE message in which the Client
   Profile is received.
1. Validate that the `Public Shared Prekey` is on the curve Ed448-Goldilocks.
   See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.

## Online Conversation Initialization

Online OTRv4 conversations are initialized through a [Query Message or a
Whitespace Tag](#user-requests-to-start-an-otr-conversation). After this, the
conversation is authenticated using the interactive DAKE.

### Requesting Conversation with Older OTR Versions

Bob might respond to Alice's request (or notification of willingness to start a
conversation) using OTRv3. If this is the case and Alice supports version 3, the
protocol falls back to OTRv3 [\[7\]](#references). If Alice does not support
version 3, this response is ignored.

### Interactive Deniable Authenticated Key Exchange (DAKE)

This section outlines the flow of the interactive DAKE. This is a way to
mutually agree upon shared keys for the two parties and authenticate one another
while providing participation deniability.

This protocol is derived from the DAKEZ protocol [\[1\]](#references), which
uses a ring signature non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge
(`RING-SIG`) for authentication (`RSig`).

Alice's long-term Ed448 key pair is `(sk_ha, Ha)` and Bob's long-term Ed448
keypair is `(sk_hb, Hb)`. Both keypairs are generated as stated in the
[Public keys, shared prekeys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-and-fingerprints)
section. Alice and Bob also have long-term Ed448 forging public keys. These are
denoted `Fa` for Alice's, and `Fb` for Bob's.

#### Interactive DAKE Overview

```
Alice                                           Bob
---------------------------------------------------
       Query Message or Whitespace Tag -------->
       <----------------------- Identity message
       Auth-R --------------------------------->
       <--------------------------------- Auth-I
```

Bob will be initiating the DAKE with Alice.

**Bob:**

1. Generates an Identity message, as defined in
   [Identity Message](#identity-message) section.
1. Sets `Y` and `y` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
1. Sets `B` as  and `b` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
1. Sends Alice the Identity message with his `our_ecdh_first.public`
   and `our_dh_first.public` attached.

**Alice:**

1. Receives an Identity message from Bob:
    * Verifies the Identity message as defined in the
      [Identity message](#identity-message) section. If the verification fails
      (for example, if Bob's public keys -`Y` or `B`- are not valid), rejects
      the message and does not send anything further.
    * Picks the newest compatible version of OTR listed in Bob's profile. If
      there aren't any compatible versions, Alice does not send any further
      messages.
    * Sets `Y` as `their_ecdh`.
    * Sets `B` as `their_dh`.
    * Sets the received `our_ecdh_first.public` from Bob as `their_ecdh_first`.
    * Sets the received `our_dh_first.public` from Bob as `their_dh_first`.
1. Generates an Auth-R message, as defined in
   the [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section.
1. Sets `X` and `x` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
1. Sets `A` and `a` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
1. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
    * Calculates ECDH shared secret
      `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`. Securely deletes
      `our_ecdh.secret`, `our_ecdh.public` and `their_ecdh`. Replaces them with:
      * `our_ecdh.secret = our_ecdh_first.secret`.
      * `our_ecdh.public = our_ecdh_first.public`.
      * `their_ecdh = their_ecdh_first`.
      * Securely deletes `our_ecdh_first.secret`, `our_ecdh_first.public` and
        `their_ecdh_first`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`, `our_dh.public` and `their_dh`.
      Replaces them with:
      * `our_dh.secret = our_dh_first.secret`.
      * `our_dh.public = our_dh_first.public`.
      * `their_dh = their_dh_first`.

        `their_dh_first`.
    * Calculates the brace key
      `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`. Securely deletes
      `k_dh`.
    * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
      `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret ||K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`.
      Securely deletes `K_ecdh` and `brace_key`.
    * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `HWC(usage_SSID || K, 8)`.
1. Sends Bob the Auth-R message (see [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section),
   with her `our_ecdh_first.public` and `our_dh_first.public` attached. Alice
   must not send data messages at this point, as she still needs to receive
   the 'Auth-I' message from Bob.

**Bob:**

1. Receives the Auth-R message from Alice:
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed on Alice's profile, and follows
     the specification for this version. If the versions are incompatible, Bob
     does not send any further messages.
1. Verifies the Auth-R message as defined in the
   [Auth-R Message](#auth-r-message) section. If the verification fails
   (for example, if Alice's public keys -`X` or `A`- are not valid), rejects
   the message and does not send anything further.
   * Sets `X` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets `A` as `their_dh`.
   * Sets the received `our_ecdh_first.public` from Alice as `their_ecdh_first`.
   * Sets the received `our_dh_first.public` from Alice as `their_dh_first`.

      Replaces them with:
      * `our_ecdh.secret = our_ecdh_first.secret`.
      * `our_ecdh.public = our_ecdh_first.public`.
      * `their_ecdh = their_ecdh_first`.
      * Securely deletes `our_ecdh_first.secret`, `our_ecdh_first.public` and
        `their_ecdh_first`.
    * Calculates DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`, `our_dh.public` and `their_dh`.
      Replaces them with:
      * `our_dh.secret = our_dh_first.secret`.
      * `our_dh.public = our_dh_first.public`.
      * `their_dh = their_dh_first`.

    * Sets `since_last_dh` as 0.
    * Sets `i`, `j`, `k` `pn` as 0.
    * Sets `max_remote_i_seen` as -1.
    * Interprets `K` as the first root key (`prev_root_key`) by:
      `prev_root_key = KDF(usage_first_root_key || K, 64)`.
    * Calculates the receiving keys:
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      * Calculates `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      * Calculates `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      * Securely deletes `k_dh`.
      * Calculates the Mixed shared secret (and replaces the old value)
        `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely
        deletes `K_ecdh`.
      * Derives new set of keys:
        `curr_root_key, chain_key_r[k] = derive_ratchet_keys(receiving, prev_root_key, K)`.
      * Securely deletes the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
    * Calculates the sending keys:
      * Generates a new ECDH key pair and assigns it to
        `our_ecdh = generateECDH()` (by securely replacing the old value).
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.

      * Increments `since_last_dh = since_last_dh + 1`.
      * Increments `i = i + 1`.
1. Sends Alice the Auth-I message (see [Auth-I message](#auth-i-message)
   section).
1. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Bob:
   * In the case that he wants to immediately send a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that he will not perform a new DH ratchet, but rather start using
       the derived `chain_key_s[j]`. He should follow the
       "When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:" subsection and
        attaches his ECDH and DH public keys to this message.
   * In the case that he receives a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message)
       section. Note that he will use the already derived `chain_key_r[k]`.
       He should follow the "Try to decrypt the message with a stored skipped
       message key" or "When receiving a data message in the same DH Ratchet:"
       subsections.

**Alice:**

1. Receives the Auth-I message from Bob:
   * Verifies the Auth-I message as defined in the
     [Auth-I message](#auth-i-message) section. If the verification fails,
     rejects the message and does not send anything further.
1. Initializes the double-ratchet algorithm:
   * Sets `since_last_dh` as 0.
   * Sets `i`, `j`, `k` and `pn` as 0.
   * Sets `max_remote_i_seen` as -1.
   * Interprets `K` as the first root key (`prev_root_key`) by:
     `KDF(usage_first_root_key || K, 64)`.
   * Calculates the sending keys:
      * Calculates `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`.
      * Calculates `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
      * Calculates `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`.
      * Securely deletes `k_dh`.
      * Calculates the Mixed shared secret (and replaces the old value):
        `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely
        deletes `K_ecdh`.
      * Derives new set of keys:
        `curr_root_key, chain_key_s[j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending, prev_root_key, K)`.
      * Securely deletes the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
      * Increments `i = i + 1`.
1. At this point, the interactive DAKE is complete for Alice:
   * In the case that she wants to immediately send a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message) section.
       Note that she will not perform a new DH ratchet, but rather use the
       already derived `chain_key_s[j]`. She should follow the
       "When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:" subsection.
   * In the case that she immediately receives a data message:
     * Follows what is defined in the
       [When you receive a Data Message](#when-you-receive-a-data-message) section.
       Note that she will perform a new DH ratchet with the advertised keys
       from Bob attached in the message. If she wants to send data
       messages at this point (after receiving ones), she will perform a new DH
       ratchet as well.

#### Identity Message

This is the first message of the DAKE. It is sent to commit to a choice of ECDH
and DH key.

A valid Identity message is generated as follows:

1. If there is not a valid Client Profile, create a Client Profile, as defined
   in [Creating a Client Profile](#creating-a-client-profile) section.
   Otherwise, use the one you have on local storage.
1. Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `y` (57 bytes).
   * public key `Y`.
1. Generate an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `b` (80 bytes).
   * public key `B`.
1. Generate another ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `our_ecdh_first.secret` (57 bytes).
   * public key `our_ecdh_first.public`.
1. Generate another ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `our_dh_first.secret` (80 bytes).
   * public key `our_dh_first.public`.
1. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
   Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as the
   sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
   messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will have this
   number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify an Identity message:

When receiving an Identity message, note that the participant must not start
sending data messages, as they still need to receive the 'Auth-I' message.

1. Verify if the message type is `0x35`.
1. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
1. Validate the Client Profile, as defined in
   [Validating a Client Profile](#validating-a-client-profile) section.
1. Verify that the point `Y` received is on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Verify that the DH public key `B` is from the correct group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.

   group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.

An Identity message is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x35.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient. As the instance tag is used to
  differentiate the clients that a participant uses, this will often be 0 since
  the other party may not have set its instance tag yet.

Sender's Client Profile (CLIENT-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a Client Profile".

Y (POINT)
  The ephemeral public ECDH key.

ECDH ephemeral key and a DH ephemeral key, and to acknowledge the other
participant's ECDH ephemeral key and DH ephemeral key. This acknowledgment
includes a validation that other participant's ECDH key is on curve Ed448 and
that its DH key is in the correct group.

## Offline Conversation Initialization

To begin an offline conversation, a set of prekey messages, a Client Profile and
a Prekey Profile are published to an untrusted Prekey Server. These three
publications are defined as a Prekey Ensemble. This action is considered as the
start of the non-interactive DAKE. A Prekey Ensemble is retrieved by the party
attempting to send a message to the Prekey Ensemble publisher. This participant,
then, replies with a Non-Interactive-Auth message (created with the Prekey
Ensemble values). This action is considered to complete the non-interactive
DAKE.

### Non-interactive Deniable Authenticated Key Exchange (DAKE)

The non-interactive DAKE is a method by which two parties mutually agree upon
shared cryptographic keys while providing partial participation deniability.
Unlike the interactive DAKE, the non-interactive DAKE does not provide online
deniability for the party that completes the DAKE by sending a
Non-Interactive-Auth message. Client implementations are expected to understand
this deniability risk when allowing participants to complete a non-interactive
DAKE. They are also expected to decide how to convey this security loss to the
participant.

This protocol is derived from the XZDH protocol [\[1\]](#references), which uses
a ring signature non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (`RING-SIG`)
for authentication (`RSig`).

Alice's long-term Ed448 key pair is `(sk_ha, Ha)` and Bob's long-term Ed448 key
pair is `(sk_hb, Hb)`. Both key pairs are generated as stated in the [Public
keys, Shared prekeys and
Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-and-fingerprints) section. Alice and
Bob also have long-term Ed448 forging public keys. These are denoted `Fa` for
Alice's, and `Fb` for Bob's.

```

**Bob:**

1. If there is not a valid Client Profile, creates a Client Profile, as defined
   in [Creating a Client Profile](#creating-a-client-profile) section.
   Otherwise, use the one you have on local storage.
1. If there is not a valid Prekey Profile, creates a Prekey Profile, as defined
   in [Creating a Prekey Profile](#creating-a-prekey-profile) section.
   Otherwise, use the one you have on local storage.
1. Generates prekey messages, as defined in the
   [Prekey Message](#prekey-message) section.
1. Publishes the Client Profile, the Prekey Profile and the prekey messages to
   an untrusted Prekey Server. Note that he needs to publish a Client and Prekey
   Profile once for every long-term public key he locally has until the profiles
   respectively expire. He may upload new prekey messages at other
   times. See [Publishing Prekey Ensembles](#publishing-prekey-ensembles)
   section for details.

**Alice:**

1. Requests prekey ensembles from the untrusted server.
1. For each Prekey Ensemble received from the server:
   * [Validates each Prekey Ensemble](#validating-prekey-ensembles). If the
     verification fails, rejects the message and does not send anything further.
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed in Bob's Client Profile.
     If the versions are incompatible, Alice does not send any further
     messages.
   * Sets the received ECDH ephemeral public key `Y` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets the received DH ephemeral public key `B` as `their_dh`.
1. Extracts the Public Shared Prekey (`D_b`) from Bob's Prekey Profile. Extracts
   the Ed448 public key (`H_b`) from Bob's Client Profile. Sets
   the first as `their_shared_prekey`.
1. Generates a Non-Interactive-Auth message. See
   [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section.
1. Sets `X` and `x` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
1. Sets `A` and `a` as `our_dh`: ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
1. Calculates the Mixed shared secret (`K`) and the SSID:
   * Gets `tmp_k` generated during the generation of the
     [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message).
   * Calculates the Mixed shared secret
     `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || tmp_k, 64)`. Securely deletes `tmp_k` and
     `brace_key`.
   * Calculates the SSID from shared secret: `HWC(usage_SSID || K, 8)`.
   * Securely deletes `our_ecdh.secret`, `our_ecdh.public`. Replaces them with:
     * `our_ecdh.secret = our_ecdh_first.secret`.
     * `our_ecdh.public = our_ecdh_first.public`.
     * Securely deletes `our_ecdh_first.secret` and `our_ecdh_first.public`.
   * Securely deletes `our_dh.secret` and `our_dh.public`. Replaces them with:
     * `our_dh.secret = our_dh_first.secret`.
     * `our_dh.public = our_dh_first.public`.
     * Securely deletes `our_dh_first.secret` and `our_dh_first.public`.
1. Calculates the `Auth MAC`:
    * Calculates the value:
      ```
        Auth MAC = HCMAC(usage_auth_MAC || auth_mac_k || t, 64)
      ```
    * Includes this value in the Non-Interactive-Auth message and securely
      deletes the `auth_mac_k`.
1. Sends Bob a Non-Interactive-Auth message with
   her `our_ecdh.public` and `our_dh.public` attached. See
   [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section.
1. Initializes the double-ratchet:
   * Sets `since_last_dh` as 0.
   * Sets `i`, `j`, `k` and `pn` as 0.
   * Sets `max_remote_i_seen` as -1.
   * Calculates the root key and sending chain key:
     `curr_root_key = KDF(usage_root_key || K, 64)` and
     `chain_key_sending[j] = KDF(usage_chain_key || K, 64)`.
   * Increments `i = i + 1`.
1. At this point, the non-interactive DAKE is complete for Alice:
   * If she wants to send a data message, she follows what is defined in the
     [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message)
     section. Note that she will not perform a new DH ratchet for this message,
     but rather use the already derived `chain_key_sending[j]`. She should
     follow the  "When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:"
     subsection.

**Bob:**

1. Receives the Non-Interactive-Auth message from Alice:
   * Check that the receiver's instance tag matches your prekey message sender's
     instance tag.
   * Verify if the message type is `0x0D`.
   * Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
   * Validate the received ECDH ephemeral public key `X` is on curve Ed448.
     See [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
   * Validate that the received DH ephemeral public key `A` is on the correct
     group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
     section for details.
   * Verify that the point `our_ecdh_first.public` received is on curve Ed448.

     section for details.
   * Validates Alice's Client Profile and extracts `H_a` and `F_a` from it.
   * Retrieves his corresponding Prekey message from local storage, by
     using the 'Prekey Indentifier' attached to the Non-Interactive-Auth
     message.
     * If this 'Prekey Identifier' does not correspond to any Prekey message on
       local storage:
       * Aborts the DAKE.
     * Otherwise:
       * Sets `Y` and `y` as `our_ecdh`: the ephemeral ECDH keys.
       * Sets `B` as  and `b` as `our_dh`: the ephemeral 3072-bit DH keys.
   * Retrieves his corresponding Client Profile from local storage.

     `our_shared_prekey.public`.
   * Picks a compatible version of OTR listed on Alice's Client Profile, and
     follows the specification for this version. If the versions are
     incompatible, Bob does not send any further messages.
   * Verifies the Non-Interactive-Auth message. See
     [Non-Interactive-Auth Message](#non-interactive-auth-message) section. If
     the verification fails, rejects the message and does not send anything
     further.
1. Retrieves the ephemeral public keys from Alice:
   * Sets the received ECDH ephemeral public key `X` as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets the received DH ephemeral public key `A` as `their_dh`.
   * Sets the received `our_ecdh_first.public` from Alice as `their_ecdh_first`.
   * Sets the received `our_dh_first.public` from Alice as `their_dh_first`.
1. Calculates the keys needed for the generation of the Mixed shared secret
   (`K`):
   * Calculates the ECDH shared secret
     `K_ecdh = ECDH(our_ecdh.secret, their_ecdh)`. Securely deletes
     `our_ecdh.secret`.
   * Calculates the DH shared secret `k_dh = DH(our_dh.secret, their_dh)`.
     Securely deletes `our_dh.secret`.
   * Calculates the brace key

    ECDH(our_shared_prekey.secret, their_ecdh) || ECDH(sk_hb, their_ecdh) ||
    brace_key, 64)`. Securely deletes `K_ecdh`.
1. Computes the Auth MAC key `auth_mac_k = KDF(usage_auth_MAC_key || tmp_k, 64)`:
  * Computes `Auth MAC = HCMAC(usage_auth_MAC || auth_mac_k || t, 64)`.
     The `t` value here is the one computed during the verification of the
     Non-Interactive-Auth message.
   * Extracts the `Auth MAC` from the Non-Interactive-Auth message and verifies
     that it is equal to the one just calculated. If it is not, ignore the
     Non-Interactive-Auth message.
1. Computes the Mixed shared secret and the SSID:
   * `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret || tmp_k, 64)`. Securely deletes `tmp_k` and

   * Sets the received `their_ecdh_first` from Alice as `their_ecdh`.
   * Sets the received `their_dh_first` from Alice as `their_dh`.
1. At this point, the non-interactive DAKE is complete for Bob:
   * If he immediately receives a data message, he follows what is defined in
     the [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message)
     section. Note that he will not perform a new DH ratchet for this message,
     but rather use the already derived `chain_key_receiving[k]`.
   * If he wants to send a data message, he follows what is defined in the
     [When you send a Data Message](#when-you-send-a-data-message)
     section. Note that he will perform a new DH ratchet for this message.

#### Prekey Message

This message is created and published to an untrusted Prekey Server to allow
offline conversations. Each Prekey message contains two one-time use ephemeral
public prekey values.

A valid Prekey message is generated as follows:

1. Generate a unique random id that is going to act as an identifier for this
   prekey message. It should be 4 byte unsigned value, big-endian (INT).
1. Create the first one-time use prekey by generating the ephemeral ECDH key
   pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
    * secret key `y` (57 bytes).
    * public key `Y`.
1. Create the second one-time use prekey by generating the ephemeral DH key
   pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `b` (80 bytes).
   * public key `B`.
1. Use the same instance tag from the Client Profile and Prekey Profile's
   owner. Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this
   tag as the sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future
   received messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will
   have this number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify the Prekey message:

1. Verify if the message type is `0x0F`.
1. Verify that protocol's version of the message is `0x0004`.
1. Check that the ECDH public key `Y` is on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Verify that the DH public key `B` is from the correct group. See
   [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
   section for details.

A Prekey message is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x0F.

Prekey Message Identifier (INT)
  A prekey message id used for local storage and retrieval.

Prekey owner's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the client that created the prekey.

Y Prekey owner's ECDH public key (POINT)
  First one-time use prekey value.

B Prekey owner's DH public key (MPI)
  Second one-time use prekey value. The ephemeral public DH key. Note that even
  though this is in uppercase, this is NOT a POINT.

```

#### Non-Interactive-Auth Message

This message finishes the non-interactive DAKE. It contains a key-only
unforgeable message authentication code function. Bob sends it to Alice to
commit to a choice of his ECDH ephemeral key and his DH ephemeral key, and to
acknowledge Alice's ECDH ephemeral key and DH ephemeral key.

A valid Non-Interactive-Auth message is generated as follows:

1. If there is not a valid Client Profile, create a Client Profile, as defined
   in the [Creating a Client Profile](#creating-a-client-profile) section.
   Otherwise, use the one you have on local storage.
1. Generate an ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `x` (57 bytes).
   * public key `X`.
1. Generate an ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH Keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `a` (80 bytes).
   * public key `A`.
1. Generate another ephemeral ECDH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `our_ecdh_first.secret` (57 bytes).
   * public key `our_ecdh_first.public`.
1. Generate another ephemeral DH key pair, as defined in
   [Generating ECDH and DH keys](#generating-ecdh-and-dh-keys):
   * secret key `our_dh_first.secret` (80 bytes).
   * public key `our_dh_first.public`.
1. Compute `K_ecdh = ECDH(x, their_ecdh)`.
1. Compute `k_dh = DH(a, their_dh)` and
   `brace_key = KDF(usage_third_brace_key || k_dh, 32)`. Securely delete `k_dh`.
1. Compute
   `tmp_k = KDF(usage_tmp_key || K_ecdh || ECDH(x, their_shared_prekey) ||
    ECDH(x, H_b) || brace_key, 64)`. Securely delete `K_ecdh`.
   This value is needed for the generation of the Mixed shared secret.
1. Calculate the Auth MAC key
   `auth_mac_k = KDF(usage_auth_MAC_key || tmp_k, 64)`.
1. Compute
   `t = HWC(usage_non_int_auth_bob_client_profile || Bob_Client_Profile, 64) ||
    HWC(usage_non_int_auth_alice_client_profile || Alice_Client_Profile, 64) ||
    Y || X || B || A || their_shared_prekey ||
    HWC(usageNonIntAuthPh || phi, 64)`.
1. Compute `sigma = RSig(H_a, sk_ha, {F_b, H_a, Y}, t)`. Refer to
   the [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication) section
   for details.
1. Attach the 'Prekey Message Identifier' that is stated in the retrieved
   Prekey message.
1. Generate a 4-byte instance tag to use as the sender's instance tag.
   Additional messages in this conversation will continue to use this tag as
   the sender's instance tag. Also, this tag is used to filter future received
   messages. Messages intended for this instance of the client will have this
   number as the receiver's instance tag.

To verify a Non-Interactive-Auth message:

1. Compute
   `t = HWC(usage_non_int_auth_bob_client_profile || Bobs_Client_Profile, 64) ||
    HWC(usage_non_int_auth_alice_client_profile || Alices_Client_Profile, 64) ||
    Y || X || B || A || our_shared_prekey.public ||
    HWC(usage_non_int_auth_phi || phi, 64)`.
1. Verify `sigma` as defined in the
   [Ring Signature Authentication](#ring-signature-authentication) section. As
   multiple client profiles can coexist on local storage for a short amount of
   time, if the sigma verification fails and there are others profiles in local
   storage, use them to generate `t` and validate `sigma`:
   `RVrf({F_b, H_a, Y}, sigma, t)`.

A Non-Interactive-Auth is an OTRv4 message encoded as:

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The message has type 0x0D.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient.

Sender's Client Profile (CLIENT-PROF)
  As described in the section "Creating a Client Profile".

X (POINT)
  The ephemeral public ECDH key.

A (MPI)
  The ephemeral public DH key. Note that even though this is in uppercase, this
  is NOT a POINT.

Sigma (RING-SIG)
  The 'RING-SIG' proof of authentication value.

Prekey Message Identifier (INT)
  The 'Prekey Message Identifier' from the Prekey message that was retrieved
  from the untrusted Prekey Server, as part of the Prekey Ensemble.

Auth MAC (MAC)
  The MAC with the appropriate MAC key (see above) of the message ('t') for the
  Ring Signature ('RING-SIG').

our_ecdh_first.public
  The ephemeral public ECDH key that will be used for the intialization of
  the double ratchet algorithm.

our_dh_first.public
  The ephemeral public DH key that will be used for the intialization of
  the double ratchet algorithm.
```

#### Publishing Prekey Ensembles

For starting a non-interactive conversation, an user must publish to an
untrusted Prekey Server these values:

- A Client Profile (`CLIENT-PROF`)
- A Prekey Profile (`PREKEY-PROF`)
- A set of prekey messages

An user only needs to upload its Client Profile and Prekey Profile to the
untrusted Prekey Server once for the long-term public key it locally has,
until this profile expire or one of its values changes.

However, this party may upload new prekey messages at other times, as defined in
the [Publishing Prekey Messages](#publishing-prekey-messages) section.

The party will also need to upload a new Client Profile and a new Prekey Profile
when they expire. These new values replace the old ones. Take into account,
however, that Client Profiles and Prekey Profiles will have an overlap period of
extra validity, so they can be used when delayed encrypted offline messages
arrive. After this extra validity time ends, they must be securely deleted from
storage.

The combination of one Client Profile, one Prekey Profile and one Prekey message
is called a "Prekey Ensemble".

Details on how to interact with an untrusted Prekey Server to publish these
values are outside the scope of this protocol. They can be found in the
[OTRv4 Prekey Server Specification](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4-prekey-server).

##### Publishing Prekey Messages

An OTRv4 client must generate a user's prekey messages and publish them to an
untrusted Prekey Server. Implementers are expected to create their own policy
dictating how often their clients upload prekey messages to the Prekey Server.
Nevertheless, prekey messages should be published to the Prekey Server once the
server store of prekeys messages gets low.

#### Validating Prekey Ensembles

Use the following checks to validate a Prekey Ensemble. If any of the checks
fail, ignore the Prekey Ensemble:

1. Check that all the instance tags on the Prekey Ensemble's values are the
   same.
1. [Validate the Client Profile](#validating-a-client-profile).
1. [Validate the Prekey Profile](#validating-a-prekey-profile).
1. Check that the Prekey Profile is signed by the same long-term public key
   stated in the Client Profile.
1. Verify the Prekey message as stated in its [section](#prekey-message).
1. Check that the OTR version of the prekey message matches one of the
   versions signed in the Client Profile contained in the Prekey Ensemble.
1. Check if the Client Profile's version is supported by the receiver.

Note that these steps can be done in anticipation of sending a
Non-Interactive-Auth message.

#### Receiving Prekey Ensembles

Details on how prekey ensembles may be received from an untrusted Prekey Server
are outside the scope of this protocol. This specification assumes that none,
one or more than one prekey ensembles may arrive. It also assumes that for
every received Client Profile and Prekey Profile, at least, one prekey message
might arrive. If the prekey server cannot return one of the three values needed
for a Prekey Ensemble, the non-interactive DAKE must wait until this value can
be obtained.

Note that when a prekey message is retrieved, it should be deleted from storage
in the untrusted Prekey Server. Nevertheless, the Client Profile and the Prekey
Profile should not be deleted until they are replaced when expired or when one
of its values changed.

The following guide is meant to help implementers identify and remove invalid
prekey ensembles.

If the untrusted Prekey Server cannot return one of the three values needed for
a Prekey Ensemble (a Client Profile, a Prekey Profile and a Prekey message):

1. The non-interactive DAKE must wait until this value can be obtained.

If one Prekey Ensemble is received:

1. [Validate the Prekey Ensemble](#validating-prekey-ensembles).
1. If the Prekey Ensemble is valid, decide whether to send a
   Non-Interactive-Auth message depending on whether the long-term key in the
   Client Profile is trusted or not. This decision is optional.

If many prekey ensembles are received:

1. [Validate the Prekey Ensembles](#validating-prekey-ensembles).
1. Discard all invalid prekey ensembles.
1. Discard all duplicate prekey ensembles in the list.
1. If one Prekey Ensemble remains:
    * Decide whether to send a message using this Prekey Ensemble if the
      long-term key within the Client Profile is trusted or not. This decision
      is optional.
1. If multiple valid prekey ensembles remain:
    * If there are keys that are untrusted and trusted in the list of messages,
      decide whether to only use the trusted long-term keys; and send messages
      with each one of them. This decision is optional.
    * If there are several instance tags in the list of prekey ensembles,
      decide which instance tags to send messages to.
    * If there are multiple prekey ensembles per instance tag, decide whether
      to send multiple messages to the same instance tag.

## KCI Attacks

One aspect of online deniability that is often overlooked is the relationship
between DAKEs and key compromise impersonation attacks. A KCI attack begins when
the long-term secret key of a party is compromised. With this long-term secret
key, an attacker can impersonate other users to the owner of the key. The DAKEs
used in OTRv4 are inherently vulnerable to KCI, but this can be a desirable
property. However, OTRv4 includes forging keys to mitigate against this
vulnerability.

In theory, a user who claims to cooperate with a judge may justifiably refuse to
reveal their long-term secret key because it would make them vulnerable to
a KCI attack. The design of the DAKEs used in OTRv4 makes it impossible for the
user to provide proof of communication to a judge without revealing their
long-term secret key. This prevents a judge and informant from devising a
protocol where the judge is given cryptographic proof of communication
while the informant suffers no repercussions. However, this scenario seems to be
mostly theoretical. The more common case in practice may be the one in which the
judge has access to the party's long-term secret keys. In this latter case, a
KCI vulnerability can be a desirable property.

To prevent an scenario where a judge has access to the party's long-term secret
key and still make it impossible for this party to provide proof of
communication, we can use two alternatives:

1. In the case of the non-interactive DAKE, ask the Prekey Server for a forged
   conversation.
1. Include long-term "forger" keys in the DAKEs for both participants. This is
   the choice that OTRv4 has chosen.

### Prekey Server Forged Conversations

The security of the non-interactive DAKE does not require trusting the prekey
server used to distribute prekeys ensembles. However, if we allow a scenario in
which one party’s long-term keys have been compromised but the prekey server has
not, we can achieve better deniability properties. The party may ask the prekey
server in advance for a forged conversation, which will cast doubt on all
conversations conducted by an attacker using the compromised device.

If an attacker attempts to act as Bob in the above overview of the
non-interactive DAKE using a compromised device, then he (or a trusted
accomplice with access to Bob's long-term secret key) can impersonate Alice by
executing `RSig` with his long-term public and secret keys
(`sigma = RSig(Hb, sk_hb, {Ha, Hb, Y}, t)` instead. In practice, Bob (or
his accomplice) simply needs to run the non-interactive DAKE honestly, but
pretend to be Alice in their response to the prekey message.

If an attacker attempts to act as Alice in the above non-interactive DAKE
overview using the compromised device, we cannot offer full deniability. Alice
must ask the prekey server to return a false prekey ensemble from Bob that was
generated by Bob or his trusted accomplice, and to redirect all traffic to the
associated forging device. This false prekey ensemble must be returned to the
attacker when they request one. Alice can derive the Mixed shared secret by
using Bob's long-term public key instead of hers. In practice, the attacker can
always bypass this forgery attempt by obtaining a legitimate prekey ensemble
from Bob and using this to respond. This limitation of the non-interactive DAKE
is conjectured to be insurmountable by a two-flow non-interactive protocol
[\[13\]](#references).

### Forger Keys

For OTRv4, the above KCI vulnerability is undesirable. For this reason, the
protocol design includes 'forging keys', which should be generated and
implemented. To use them, both DAKEs are altered to include these long-term
forging keys for all participants. In the case of the non-interactive DAKE,
for example, Bob distributes these keys on his Client Profile. Alice, after
retrieving the Prekey Ensemble, extracts the 'OTRv4 public Ed448 forging key'
(`F_b`) and uses to compute `sigma = RSig(H_a, sk_ha, {F_b, Ha, Y}, t)`.

This transformation changes all long-term public keys in the protocol that are
not used in the “honest” case to reference to the forging keys instead. This
alteration allows the forging keys to be stored more securely than the “honest”
long-term public keys; since the forging keys are not needed for normal
operation, they may be stored offline. Additionally, long-term forging keys
don't need to be generated like the "honest" long-term public keys; they can be
a random valid point on the curve, as described
in [Public keys, Shared Prekeys, Forging keys and Fingerprints](#public-keys-shared-prekeys-forging-keys-and-fingerprints)
section. Alternatively, the forging secret keys can be destroyed immediately
after generation. This last technique have to be implemented as an option for
users: a secure messaging application should ask users whether or not they would
like to save the forging keys during setup. Even if most users select the
default option to securely erase the forging keys, thereby preventing them from
performing the online forgery techniques described in the section above, someone
watching the protocol execution does not generally know the choice of a
particular user. Consequently, a judge that engages in a conversation using a
compromised device is given two explanations: either the conversation is
genuine, or the owner of the device was one of the users that elected to store
the forgery keys and they are using those keys to forge the conversation.

Note that forging keys have to be included in the generation of the fingerprint
as well, as this will prevent an attack where a judge forces a participant (Bob,
for example) to use specific keys as the forging long-term key and the
ephemeral DAKE key, and advertise this new forging key in a new published Client
Profile. When Alice performs a DAKE with Bob, she sends Bob her ring signature
(in the 'Auth-R' message, for example). Since the judge knows the private keys
associated with the coerced keys (the forger and ephemeral one), the judge
learns that the signature is from Alice (as only she could have made it), which
generates proof of Alice participation. In this case, Bob does not suffer any
repercussions as he can simply let the compromised Client Profile expire and
update his forging key to other value that he generated himself. To prevent this
attack, Alice should always verify that, when performing a DAKE, only the keys
that she trusts (because she has done a manual fingerprint verification or
executed the Socialist Millionaires Protocol with Bob) are the ones actually
used, so it is not that easy for a judge to coerce Bob to change his long-term
forging keys without raising suspicion. Nevertheless, a judge can always try to
force Bob to do a manual fingerprint verification of the coerced keys with
Alice. This will likely trick her into believing that those are Bob's
non-coerced keys. This latter scenario seems difficult to perform without
raising suspicion.

## Data Exchange

This section describes how each participant will use the Double Ratchet
algorithm to exchange [Data Messages](#data-message). The Double Ratchet
algorithm is initialized with the shared secret established in the DAKE and the
public keys immediately exchanged. Detailed validation and processing of each
data message is described in the
[sending a Data Message](#sending-a-data-message)
and [receiving a Data Messages](#receiving-a-data-message) sections.

A data message with an empty human-readable part (the plaintext is of zero
length, or starts with a `NULL`) is a "heartbeat" message. This message is
useful for key rotations and revealing MAC keys. It should not be displayed to
the participant. If you have not sent a message to a correspondent in some
(configurable) time, send a "heartbeat" message. The "heartbeat" message should
have the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.

### Data Message

This message is used to transmit a private message to the correspondent. It is
also used to [Reveal Old MAC Keys](#revealing-mac-keys). This data message is
encoded as defined in the [Encoded Messages](#encoded-messages) section.

The plaintext message (either before encryption or after decryption) consists of
a human-readable message (encoded in UTF-8, optionally with HTML markup),
optionally followed by:

* a single `NUL` (a BYTE with value 0x00)
* zero or more TLV (type/length/value) records (with no padding between them)

#### Data Message Format

```
Protocol version (SHORT)
  The version number of this protocol is 0x0004.

Message type (BYTE)
  The Data Message has type 0x03.

Sender's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the person sending this message.

Receiver's instance tag (INT)
  The instance tag of the intended recipient.

Flags (BYTE)
  The bitwise-OR of the flags for this message. Usually you should set this to
  0x00. The only currently defined flag is:

  IGNORE_UNREADABLE (0x01)

    If you receive a Data Message with this flag set, and you are unable to
    decrypt the message or verify the MAC (because, for example, you don't have
    the right keys), just ignore the message instead of producing an error or a
    notification to the participant.

Previous chain message number (INT)
  This should be set with sender's pn.

Ratchet id (INT)
  This should be set with sender's i.

Message id (INT)
  This should be set with sender's j.

Public ECDH Key (POINT)
  This is the public part of the ECDH key pair. For the sender of this message,
  this is their 'our_ecdh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is
  used as 'their_ecdh'.

Public DH Key (MPI)
  This is the public part of the DH key pair. For the sender of this message, it
  is 'our_dh.public' value. For the receiver of this message, it is used as
  'their_dh'. If this value is empty, its length is zero.

Encrypted message (DATA)
  Using the appropriate encryption key (see below) derived from the sender's
  and recipient's ECDH and DH public keys (with the keyids given in this
  message), perform an encryption of the message using ChaCha20. The 'nonce'
  used for this operation is set to 0.

Authenticator (MAC)
  The MAC with the appropriate MAC key (see below) of everything: from the
  protocol version to the end of the encrypted message. Note that old MAC keys
  are not included in this field.

Old MAC keys to be revealed (DATA)
  See "Revealing MAC Keys" section. This corresponds to the 'mac_keys_to_reveal'
  variable.
```

#### When you send a Data Message:

In order to send a data message, a key is required to encrypt the
message in it. This per-message key (`MKenc`) is the output key from the sending
and receiving KDF chains. As defined in [\[2\]](#references), the KDF keys for
these chains are called 'chain keys'. When a participant wants to send a data
message after receiving another one, ratchet keys should be rotated (the ECDH
keys, the brace key, the root key and the sending chain key) and the `j`
parameter should be set to 0. This latter process is called a DH Ratchet.

Given a new DH Ratchet:

  * Rotate the ECDH keys and brace key, see
    [Rotating ECDH Keys and Brace Key as sender](#rotating-ecdh-keys-and-brace-key-as-sender)
    section.
    The new ECDH public key created by the sender in this process will be the
    'Public ECDH Key' for the message. If a new public DH key is created in
    this process, it will be the 'Public DH Key' for the message. If it is
    not created (meaning it is only a KDF of the previous one), then it will be
    empty.
  * Calculate the Mixed shared secret
    `K = KDF(usage_shared_secret  || K_ecdh || brace_key, 64)`. Securely deletes
    `K_ecdh`.
  * Interpret `curr_root_key` as `prev_root_key`, if present.
  * Derive new set of keys:
    `curr_root_key, chain_key_s[j] = derive_ratchet_keys(sending, prev_root_key, K)`.
  * Securely delete the previous root key (`prev_root_key`) and `K`.
  * If present, forget and reveal MAC keys. The conditions for revealing MAC
    keys are stated in the [Revealing MAC Keys](#revealing-mac-keys) section.
  * Derive the next sending chain key, `MKenc` and `MKmac`, and encrypt the
    message as described below.

When sending a data message in the same DH Ratchet:

  * Set `i - 1` as the Data message's ratchet id.
  * Set `j` as the Data message's message id.
  * Set `pn` as the Data message's previous chain message number.
  * Derive the next sending chain key
    `chain_key_s[j+1] = KDF(usage_next_chain_key || chain_key_s[j], 64)`.
  * Calculate the encryption key (`MKenc`), the MAC key (`MKmac`) and, if needed
    the extra symmetric key:

   ```
     MKenc, MKmac = derive_enc_mac_keys(chain_key_s[j])
     extra_symm_key = KDF(usage_extra_symm_key || 0xFF || chain_key_s[j], 64)
   ```

  * Securely delete `chain_key_s[j]`.
  * Set `nonce` to 0.
  * Use only the first 32 bytes of `MKenc` to encrypt the message:

   ```
     encrypted_message = Chacha20_Enc(MKenc, nonce, m)
   ```

  * Use the `MKmac` to create a MAC tag. MAC all the sections of the data
    message from the protocol version to the encrypted message.

   ```
     Authenticator = HWMAC(usage_authenticator || MKmac || data_message_sections, 64)
   ```

  * Increment the next sending message id `j = j + 1`.
  * Securely delete `MKenc` and `MKmac`.
  * Continue to use the sender's instance tag.

#### When you receive a Data Message:

The counterpart of the sending an encoded data message. As that one, it also
needs a per-message key derived from the previous chain key to decrypt the
message. If the receiving 'Public ECDH Key' has not yet been seen, ratchet keys
should be rotated (the ECDH keys, the brace key, the root key and the receiving
chain key). It also checks for duplicated messages and discards them.

Decrypting a data message consists of:

1. If the received encrypted message corresponds to an stored message key
   corresponding to an skipped message, the message is verified and decrypted
   with that key. Once used, that key is deleted from the storage.
1. If a new DH ratchet key is received, any message keys corresponding to
   skipped messages from the previous receiving DH ratchet are stored. A new DH
   ratchet is performed. The message is then verified and decrypted.
1. If a new message from the current receiving ratchet is received, any message
   keys corresponding to skipped messages from the same ratchet are stored, and
   a symmetric-key ratchet is performed to derive the current message key and
   the next receiving chain key. The message is then verified and decrypted.

If an error is raised or something fails (e.g. the MAC verification of the
message fails), the message should be discarded, and any changes to the state
variables or key variables should be discarded as well.

The decryption mechanism works as:

* Check that the receiver's instance tag matches your sender's instance tag.
  * If they do not match, discard the message.

* Try to decrypt the message with a stored skipped message key:

  * If the received `message_id` and `Public ECDH Key` are in the

    * Calculate `MKmac = KDF(usage_MAC_key || MKenc, 64)`.

        * Derive (this is done any time a message key is stored as

      * Increment the receiving message id `k = k + 1`.
      * Set `nonce` to 0.

      ```
        decrypted_message = ChaCha20_Dec(MKenc, nonce, m)
      ```

      * If the message cannot be decrypted:
        * Reject the message.

      * Securely delete `MKenc`.
      * Set `their_ecdh` as the 'Public ECDH key' from the message.
      * Set `their_dh` as the 'Public DH Key' from the message, if it is not
        empty.
      * Add `MKmac` to the list `mac_keys_to_reveal`.
   * Set `max_remote_i_seen` to `ratchet_id`.

* If a message arrives that corresponds to a message key already deleted or that
  cannot be derived:
  * Reject the message.

### Deletion of Stored Message Keys

Storing message keys from messages that haven't arrived yet introduces some
risks, as defined in [\[2\]](#references):

1. A malicious sender could induce receivers to store large numbers of skipped
   message keys, possibly causing a denial-of-service due to consuming storage
   space.
1. An adversary can capture and drop some messages from sender, even though they
   didn't reach the recipient. The attacker can later compromise the intended
   recipient at a later time to reveal the stored message keys that correspond
   to the dropped messages. The adversary can then retroactively decrypt the
   captured messages.

To mitigate the first risk, parties should set reasonable per-conversation
limits on the number of possible stored message keys (e.g. 1000). This limit
is set by the implementers.

To mitigate the second risk, parties should delete stored message keys after an
appropriate interval. This deletion could be triggered by a timer, or by
counting the number of events (messages received, DH ratchet steps, etc.). This
should be decided by the implementer. This partially defends against the second
risk as it only protects "lost" messages, not messages sent using a new
DH ratchet key that has not yet been received by the compromised party.
To also defend against the second risk, the session should be regularly expired,
as defined in the [Session Expiration](#session-expiration) section.

### Extra Symmetric Key

Like OTRv3, OTRv4 defines an additional symmetric key that can be derived by
the communicating parties for use of application-specific purposes, such as
file transfer, voice encryption, etc. When one party wishes to use the extra
symmetric key, they create a type 7 TLV, which they attach to a Data Message.
The extra symmetric key itself is then derived using the same `chain_key` used
to compute the message encryption key used to protect the Data Message. It is,
therefore, derived by calculating `KDF(usage_extra_symm_key || 0xFF || chain_key)`.

Upon receipt of the Data Message containing the type 7 TLV, the recipient will
compute the extra symmetric key in the same way. Note that the value of the
extra symmetric key is not contained in the TLV itself.

If more keys are wished to be derived from this already calculated extra
symmetric key, this can be done by taking the index from the TLV list received
in the data message and the context received in 7 TLV (the 4-byte indication
of what this symmetric key will be used for), and use them as inputs to a KDF:

```
  symkey1 = KDF(index || context || extra_sym_key, 64)
```

So, if for example, these TLVs arrive with the data message:

```
  TLV 1
  TLV 7   context: 0x0042
  TLV 2
  TLV 7   context: 0x104A
  TLV 3
  TLV 7   context: 0x0001
```

Three keys can, therefore, be calculated from the already derived extra
symmetric key:

```
  extra_sym_key = KDF(usage_extra_symm_key || 0xFF || chain_key, 64)
  symkey1 = KDF(0x00 || 0x0042 || extra_sym_key, 64)
  symkey2 = KDF(0x01 || 0x104A || extra_sym_key, 64)
  symkey3 = KDF(0x02 || 0x0001 || extra_sym_key, 64)
```

Every derived key and the `extra_symm_key` should be deleted after being used.

### Revealing MAC Keys

Old MAC keys are keys from already received messages, that will no longer be
used to verify the authenticity of that message. We reveal them in order to
provide [Forgeability of Messages](#forging-transcripts): once MAC keys are
revealed, anyone can modify an OTR message and still have it appear as valid.

A MAC key is added to `mac_keys_to_reveal` list after a participant has verified
the message associated with that MAC key. They are also added if the session is
expired or when the storage of message keys gets deleted, and the MAC keys for
messages that have not arrived are derived.

Old MAC keys are formatted as a list of 64-byte concatenated values. The first
data message sent every ratchet reveals them or the TLV type 1 that is used when
the session is expired.

## Fragmentation

Some networks may have a _maximum message size_ that is too small to contain
an encoded OTR message. In that event, the sender may choose to split the
message into a number of fragments. This section describes the format for the
fragments.

OTRv4 fragmentation and reassembly procedure needs to be able to break
OTR messages into an almost arbitrary number of pieces that can be later
reassembled. The receiver of the fragments uses the identifier field to ensure
that fragments of different messages are not mixed. The fragment index
field tells the receiver the position of a fragment in the original data
message. These fields provide sufficient information to reassemble data
messages.

OTRv4 and OTRv3 perform fragmentation in different ways. As OTRv4 supports an
out-of-order network model, fragmentation is different. Nevertheless, for
both OTR versions, message parsing should happen after the message has been
defragmented.

All OTRv4 clients must be able to reassemble received fragments, but performing
fragmentation on outgoing messages is optional.

For fragmentation in OTRv3, refer to the "Fragmentation" section on OTRv3
specification.

### Transmitting Fragments

If you have information about the _maximum message size_ you are able to send
(different IM networks have different limits), you can fragment an encoded
OTR message as follows:

  * Start with the OTR message as you would normally transmit it. For example,
    a Data Message would start with
    `?OTR:AAQD` and end with `.`.
  * Assign an identifier, which will be used specifically for this fragmented
    data message. This is done in order to not confuse these fragments with
    other data message's fragments. The identifier is a unique randomly
    generated 4-byte value that must be unique for the time the data message
    is fragmented.
  * Break it up into sufficiently small pieces. Let this number of pieces be
    `total`, and the pieces be `piece[1],piece[2],...,piece[total]`.
  * Transmit `total` OTRv4 fragmented messages with the following (printf-like)
    structure (as `index` runs from 1 to `total` inclusive:

  ```
  "?OTR|%x|%x|%x,%hu,%hu,%s,", identifier, sender_instance, receiver_instance, index, total, piece[index]
  ```

  OTRv3 messages get fragmented in a similar format, but without the identifier
  field:

  ```
  "?OTR|%x|%x,%hu,%hu,%s,", sender_instance, receiver_instance, index, total, piece[index]
  ```

The message should begin with `?OTR|` and end with `,`.

Note that `index` and `total` are unsigned short int (2 bytes), and each has a
maximum value of 65535. Each `piece[index]` must be non-empty. The `identifier`,
instance tags, `index` and `total` values may have leading zeros.

Note that fragments are not messages that can be fragmented: you can't fragment
a fragment.

### Receiving Fragments

A reassemble process does not to be implemented in precesely the way we are
going to describe; but the process implemented in a library has to be able to
correctly reassemble the fragments.

If you receive a message containing `?OTR|` (note that you'll need to check
for this _before_ checking for any of the other `?OTR:` markers):

  * Parse it (as the previous printf structure) extracting the `identifier`,
    the instance tags, `index`, `total`, and `piece[index]`.

  * Discard the message and optionally pass a warning to the participant if:
    * The recipient's own instance tag does not match the listed receiver
      instance tag, and
    * The listed receiver's instance tag is not zero.

  * Discard the (illegal) fragment if:
    * `index` is 0
    * `total` is 0
    * `index` is bigger than `total`

  * For the first fragment that arrives (there is not a current buffer with the
    same `identifier`):
    * Create a buffer which will keep track of the portions of the fragmented
      data message that have arrived (by filling up it with fragments).
    * Optionally, initialize a timer for the reassembly of the fragments as it
      is possible that some fragments of the data message might never show up.
      This timer ensures that a client will not be "forever" waiting for a
      fragment. If the timer runs out, all stored fragments in this buffer
      should be discarded.
    * Let `B` be the buffer, `I` be the currently stored identifier, `T` the
      currently stored `total` and `C` a counter that keeps track of the
      received number of fragments for this buffer. If you have no currently
      stored fragments, there are no buffers, and `I`, `T` and `C` equal 0.
    * Set the length of the buffer as `total`: `len(B) = total`.
    * If `index` is empty, store `piece` at the `index` given position:
      `insert(piece, index)`. If it is not, reject the fragment and do not
      increment the buffer counter.
    * Let `total` be `T` and `identifier` be `I` for the buffer.
    * Increment the buffer counter: `C = C + 1`.

  * If `identifier == I`:
    * If `total == T`, and `C < T`:
      * Check that the given position of the buffer is empty:
        `B[index] == NULL`. If it is not, reject the fragment and do not
        increment the buffer counter.
      * Store the `piece` at the given position in the buffer:
        `insert(piece, index)`.
      * Increment the buffer counter: `C = C + 1`.
    * Otherwise:
      * Forget any stored fragments of this buffer you may have.
      * Reset `C` and `I` to 0, and discard this buffer.

  * Otherwise:
    * Consider this fragment as part of another buffer: either create a new
      buffer or insert the fragment into one that has already been created.

After this, if the current buffer's `C == T`, treat the buffer as the received
data message.

If you receive a non-OTR message or an unfragmented message:

* Keep track of the buffers you may already have. Do not discard them.

For example, here is a Data Message we would like to transmit over a network
with an unreasonably small `maximum message size`:

    ?OTR:AAMDJ+MVmSfjFZcAAAAAAQAAAAIAAADA1g5IjD1ZGLDVQEyCgCyn9hb
    rL3KAbGDdzE2ZkMyTKl7XfkSxh8YJnudstiB74i4BzT0W2haClg6dMary/jo

    AAAEAAAAHwNiIi5Ms+4PsY/L2ipkTtquknfx6HodLvk3RAAAAAA==.

We could fragment this message into three pieces:

    ?OTR|3c5b5f03|5a73a599|27e31597,00001,00003,?OTR:AAMDJ+MVmSfjFZcAAAAA

## The Protocol State Machine

An OTR client maintains separate state for every correspondent. For example,
Alice may have an active OTR conversation with Bob, while having an insecure
conversation with Charlie.

The way the client reacts to user input and to received messages depends on
whether the client has decided to allow version 3 and/or 4, if encryption is
required and if it will advertise OTR support.

### Protocol States

```
START

  This is the initial state before an OTRv4 or OTRv3 conversation starts. The
  only way to enter this state is for the participant to explicitly request it
  via some UI operation. Messages sent in this state are plaintext messages. If
  a TLV type 1 (Disconnected) message is sent in ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES state,
  transition to this state (except when the session is expired). Note that this
  transition only happens when TLV type 1 message is sent, not when it is
  received.

WAITING_AUTH_R

  This is the state used when a participant is waiting for an Auth-R message.
  This state is entered after an Identity message is sent.

WAITING_AUTH_I

  This is the state used when a participant is waiting for an Auth-I message.
  This state is entered after sending an Auth-R message.

ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES

  This state is entered after the DAKE is finished. The interactive DAKE is
  finished, for Bob, after the Auth-I message is sent, and, for Alice, when the
  Auth-I message is received and validated. The non-interactive DAKE is
  finished, for Alice, when the Non-Interactive-Auth message is sent, and, for
  Bob, when the Non-Interactive-Auth message is received and validated. Outgoing
  messages sent in this state are encrypted. Query messages or plaintext with
  withespace tags are not allowed to be sent in this state.

FINISHED

  This state is entered only when a participant receives a TLV type 1
  (Disconnected) message, which indicates they have terminated their side
  of the OTRv4 conversation. For example, if Alice and Bob are having an OTRv4
  conversation, and Bob instructs his OTRv4 client to end its private session
  with Alice (for example, by logging out), Alice will be notified of this,
  and her client will switch to the FINISHED state. This prevents Alice from
  accidentally sending a message to Bob in plaintext (consider what happens
  if Alice was in the middle of typing a private message to Bob when he
  suddenly closes the session, just as Alice hits the 'enter' key). Note that
  this transition only happens when TLV type 1 message from OTRv4 is received,
  not when it is sent. This state indicates that outgoing messages are not
  delivered at all. If a OTRv3 message is received in this state, it should be
  ignored.
```

### Protocol Events

The following sections outline the actions that the protocol should implement.
This assumes that the client is initialized with the allowed versions
(3 and/or 4).

There are thirteen events an OTRv4 client must handle (for version 3 messages,
please refer to the previous OTR protocol document. The only state where OTRv3
messages are taken into account is the `START` state):

* Received messages:
  * Plaintext without the whitespace tag
  * Plaintext with the whitespace tag
  * Query Messages
  * Error Message
  * Identity Message
  * Auth-R Message
  * Auth-I Message
  * Non-Interactive-Auth Message
  * Data Message

* User actions:
  * User requests to start an OTR conversation
  * Starting a conversation interactively
  * User requests to end an OTR conversation
  * Sending an encrypted data message

For version 4 messages, someone receiving a message with a recipient instance
tag specified that does not equal their own, should discard the message and
optionally warn the user. The exception here is the Identity Message where the
receiver's instance tag may be 0, indicating that no particular instance is
specified, and the Prekey Ensemble, whose values do not include this field.

#### User requests to start an OTR Conversation

Send an OTR Query Message or a plaintext message with a whitespace
tag to the correspondent. [Query Messages](#query-messages) and [Whitespace
Tags](#whitespace-tags) are constructed according to the sections below.

##### Query Messages

If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she would like to use OTR, she sends
a message containing the string "?OTRv" followed by an indication of what
versions of OTR she is willing to use with Bob. The versions she is willing to
use, whether she can set this on a global level or per-correspondent basis, is
up to the implementer. However, enabling users to choose whether they want to
allow or disallow a version is required, as OTR clients can set different
policies for different correspondents. For example, Alice could set up her
client so that it speaks only OTR version 4, except with Charlie, who she knows
has only an old client; so that it will opportunistically start an OTR
conversation whenever it detects the correspondent supports it; or so that it
refuses to send non-encrypted messages to Bob, ever.

Note that query Messages are not allowed to be sent
in `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.

The version string is constructed as follows:

If Alice is willing to use OTR, she appends a byte identifier for the versions
in question, followed by "?". The byte identifier for OTR version 3 is "3", and
"4" for 4. Thus, if she is willing to use OTR versions 3 and 4, the identifier
would be "34". The order of the identifiers between the "v" and the "?" does not
matter, but none should be listed more than once. The OTRv4 specification only
supports versions 3 and higher. Thus, query messages for older versions have
been omitted.

Example query messages:

```
"?OTRv3?"
    Version 3
"?OTRv45x?"
    Version 4, and hypothetical future versions identified by "5" and "x"
"?OTRv?"
    A bizarre claim that Alice would like to start an OTR conversation, but is
    unwilling to speak any version of the protocol. Although this is
    syntactically valid, the receiver will not reply when receiving this.
```

These strings may be hidden from the user (for example, in an attribute of an
HTML tag), and may be accompanied by an explanatory message which should not
reveal information regarding the participants (an example can be "Your buddy has
requested an Off-the-Record private conversation."). If Bob is willing to use
OTR with Alice (with a protocol version that Alice has offered), he should start
the AKE or DAKE according to the compatible version he supports.

##### Whitespace Tags

If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she is willing to use OTR, she can
attach a special whitespace tag to any plaintext message she sends him. A
Whitespace tag may occur anywhere in the message, and may be hidden from the
user (as in the [Query Messages](#query-messages)). There should be only one
whitespace tag per message. In the case that multiple whitespace tags arrive,
only the first one should be considered as valid.

The tag consists of the following 16 bytes, followed by one or more sets of
8 bytes indicating the version of OTR Alice is willing to use:

```
  Always send "\x20\x09\x20\x20\x09\x09\x09\x09"
  "\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20",
  followed by one or more of:
    "\x20\x20\x09\x09\x20\x20\x09\x09"
  to indicate a willingness to use OTR version 3 with Bob or
    "\x20\x20\x09\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20"
  to indicate a willingness to use OTR version 4 with Bob
```

If Bob is willing to use OTR with Alice, with the protocol version that Alice
has offered, he should start the AKE or DAKE. On the other hand, if Alice
receives a plaintext message from Bob (rather than an initiation of the AKE or
DAKE), she should stop sending him a whitespace tag.

#### Receiving plaintext without the whitespace tag

Display the message to the user. Depending on the policy set up by the
client or the mode in which it was initiated, the user should be warned that
the message received was unencrypted.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` or `FINISHED`:

  * Display the message to the user, depending on the policy set up by the
    client or the mode in which it was initiated. The user should be warned that
    the message received was unencrypted.

For OTRv3, if msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:

  * Display the message to the user. The user should be warned that the message
    received was unencrypted.

#### Receiving plaintext with the whitespace tag

Remove the whitespace tag and display the message to the user. Depending on the
policy set up by the client or the mode in which it was initiated, the user
should be warned that the message received was unencrypted.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` or `FINISHED`:

  * Remove the whitespace tag and display the message to the user. The user
    should be warned that the message received was unencrypted.

For OTRv3, if msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:

  * Display the message to the user. The user should be warned that the message
    received was unencrypted.

In any event:

  * If the tag offers OTR version 4 and version 4 is allowed:
    * Send an Identity message.
    * Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

  * If the tag offers OTR version 3 and version 3 is allowed:
    * Send a version `3 D-H Commit Message`.
    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`.

#### Sending a Query Message after an offline conversation

In the case that a party received offline messages, comes online and wants to
send online messages:

   * Send a TLV type 1 (Disconnected).
   * Send a Query Message.

#### Receiving a Query Message

If the Query Message offers OTR version 4 and version 4 is allowed:

  * Send an Identity message.
  * Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

If the Query message offers OTR version 3 and version 3 is allowed:

  * Send a version `3 D-H Commit Message`.
  * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`.

#### Starting a conversation interactively

Rather than requesting to start an encrypted conversation, Alice can directly
start a OTRv4 conversation with Bob if she is certain that they both support it
and are willing to do so. In such case, Alice should:

* Send an Identity message.
* Transition the state to `WAITING_AUTH_R`.

For how to start a conversation interactively, check the
[modes](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/tree/master/modes) folder, either the
OTRv4-interactive-only mode or the OTRv4-standalone-mode one.

#### Receiving an Identity Message

If the state is `START`:

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
    Note that after receiving an Indentity message, a participant must not start
    sending data messages.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Remember the sender's instance tag to use as the receiver's instance tag
      for future messages.
    * Reply with an Auth-R message.
    * Transition to the `WAITING_AUTH_I` state.

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  ```
    You and the other participant have sent Identity messages to each other.
    This can happen if they send you an Identity message before receiving
    yours. Only one Identity message must be chosen for use.
  ```

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Compare the hashed `B` you sent in your Identity message with the DH value
      from the message you received, considered as 32-byte unsigned big-endian
      values.
    * If yours is the higher hash value:
      * Ignore the incoming Identity message, but resend your Identity message.
        This means that the other side have the lower hash value and, therefore,
        will keep going as stated below.
    * Otherwise:
      * Forget the old `our_ecdh`, `our_dh`, `our_ecdh_first.public`
        and `our_dh_first.public` values that you sent earlier.
      * Pretend you are on `START` state.
      * Send a new Auth-R message.
      * Transition state to `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_I`:

  ```
    There are a number of reasons that you may receive an Identity Message in
    this state. Perhaps your correspondent simply started a new DAKE or they
    resent their Identity Message. On some networks, like AIM, if your
    correspondent is logged in multiple times, each of his clients will send an
    Identity Message in response to a Query Message. Resending the same Auth-R
    Message in response to each of those messages will prevent compounded
    confusion, since each of their clients will see each of the Auth-R Messages
    you send.
  ```

  * Validate the Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Forget the old `their_ecdh`, `their_dh`, `their_ecdh_first`,
      `their_dh_first` and Client Profile from the previously received Identity
      message.
    * Send a new Auth-R message with the new values received.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` or `FINISHED`:

  * Validate the new Identity message. Ignore the message if validation fails.
  * If validation succeeds:
    * Remember the sender's instance tag to use as the receiver's instance tag
      for future messages.
    * Reply with an Auth-R message.
    * Transition to the `WAITING_AUTH_I` state.

Otherwise:
   * Ignore the message.

#### Sending an Auth-R Message

* Generate and send an Auth-R Message.
* Transition to state `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

#### Receiving an Auth-R Message

If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using, ignore the message.
  * Validate the Auth-R message.
    * If validation fails:
      * Ignore the message.
      * Stay in state `WAITING_AUTH_R`.
    * If validation succeeds:
      * Reply with an Auth-I message, as defined in
        [Sending an Auth-I Message](#auth-i-message) section.
    * Transition to the `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.

If the state is not `WAITING_AUTH_R`:

  * Ignore this message.

#### Sending an Auth-I Message

* Generate and send an Auth-I message.
* Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
  [Interactive DAKE Overview](#interactive-dake-overview) section.
* Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.

#### Receiving an Auth-I Message

* If the state is `WAITING_AUTH_I`:
  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using, ignore this message.
  * Validate the Auth-I message.
    * If validation fails:
      * Ignore the message.
      * Stay in state `WAITING_AUTH_I`.

    * If validation succeeds:
      * Transition to state `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.
      * Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
        [Interactive DAKE Overview](#interactive-dake-overview) section.
      * If a plaintext message is waiting to be sent, encrypt it and send it.
      * If there are stored received Data Messages, remove them from storage
        - there is no way these messages are valid for the current DAKE.

* If the state is not `WAITING_AUTH_I`:

  * Ignore this message.

#### Sending a Data Message to an offline participant

* Generate and send a Non-Interactive-Auth message (replace any state or key
  variables).
* Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
  [Non-Interactive DAKE Overview](#non-interactive-dake-overview) section.
* If not already in this state, transition `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.
* If there is a recent stored plaintext message, encrypt it and send it.

#### Receiving a Non-Interactive-Auth Message

* If the state is `FINISHED` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:
  * Ignore the message.

* Else (including any interactive state):
  * If the receiver's instance tag in the message is not the sender's instance
    tag you are currently using:
    * Ignore this message.

  * Otherwise:
    * Forget any set values (state or key variables).
    * Validate the Non-Interactive-Auth message.
    * Initialize the double ratcheting, as defined in the
      [Non-Interactive DAKE Overview](#non-interactive-dake-overview) section.
    * Transition to state to `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`.
    * If a plaintext message is waiting to be sent, encrypt it and send it.
    * If there are stored received Data Messages, remove them from storage
      - there is no way these messages are valid for the current DAKE.

#### Sending a Data Message

The `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state is the only state where a participant is allowed
to send encrypted data messages.

If the state is `START`, `WAITING_AUTH_R`, `WAITING_AUTH_I`:

  * Queue the message for encrypting and sending it when the participant
    transitions to the `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.

If the state is `FINISHED`, the participant must start another OTRv4 conversation
to send encrypted messages:

  * Inform the user that the message cannot be sent at this time.
  * Store the plaintext message for possible retransmission.

If the state is `ENCRYPTED`:

  * Encrypt the message, and send it as a Data Message.

#### Receiving a Data Message

A received data message will look like this:

```
  ["?OTR" || protocol version || message type || sender's instance_tag ||receiver's instance tag ||
    flags || previous chain message number || ratchet id || message id || public ECDH key ||
    public DH key || enc(plaintext message || TLV) || authenticator ||
    old MAC keys to be revealed ]
```

If the version is 4:

* If the state is not `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`:
  * If this is the first DH ratchet after a DAKE, store this message for a
    configurable, short amount of time configurable by the client (10-60 minutes
    is recommended).
  * Otherwise:
    * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received by
      replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_2`.

* Otherwise:
  * Validate the data message:
     * Verify that the message type is `0x03`.
     * Verify the MAC tag.
     * Check if the message version is allowed.
     * Check that the instance tag in the message is the instance tag you are
       currently using.
     * Verify that the public ECDH key is on curve Ed448. See
       [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
       section for details.
     * Verify that the public DH key is from the correct group. See
       [Verifying that an integer is in the DH group](#verifying-that-an-integer-is-in-the-dh-group)
       section for details.

    * If the message is not valid in any of the above steps:
      * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received by
        replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_1`.

    * Otherwise:
      * Derive the corresponding decryption key depending if you are on a new
        DH ratchet, if you have stored keys or not. Try to decrypt the message.
      * If the message cannot be decrypted (e.g., this is a duplicated message
        which key has already been used) and the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag is
        not set:
          * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received
            by replying with an Error Message: `ERROR_1`.

      * If the message cannot be decrypted and the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag is
        set:
          * Ignore it instead of producing an error or a notification to the
            user.

      * If the message can be decrypted:
          * Display the human-readable part (if non empty) to the user.
            SMP TLVs should be addressed according to the SMP state machine.
          * If the received message contains a TLV type 1 (Disconnected):
            * Forget all encryption keys for this correspondent and transition
              the state to `FINISHED`.

      * If you have not sent a message to this correspondent in some
        (configurable) time, send a "heartbeat" message. The heartbeat message
        should have the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.

If the version is 3:

* If msgstate is `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`:
    * Verify the information (MAC, keyids, ctr value, etc) in the message.
    * If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are
      currently using:
      * Discard the message and optionally warn the user.

    * If the verification succeeds:
      * Decrypt the message and display the human-readable part (if non-empty)
        to the user.
      * Update the D-H encryption keys, if necessary.
      * If you have not sent a message to this correspondent in some
        (configurable) time, send a "heartbeat" message, consisting of a Data
        Message encoding an empty plaintext. The heartbeat message should have
        the `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` flag set.
      * If the received message contains a TLV type 1, forget all encryption
        keys for this correspondent, and transition msgstate to
        `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`.

    * Otherwise, inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was
      received, and reply with an Error Message, as defined in OTRv3 protocol.

* If msgstate is `MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT` or `MSGSTATE_FINISHED`:
   * Inform the user that an unreadable encrypted message was received, and
     reply with an Error Message, as defined in OTRv3 protocol.

#### Receiving an Error Message

* Detect if an error code exists in the form `ERROR_x` where x is a number.
* If the error code exists in the spec:
  * Display the human-readable error message to the user.

* Otherwise:
  * Ignore the message.

If using version 3 and `ERROR_START_AKE` policy is set (which expects that the
AKE will start when receiving an OTR Error message, as defined in OTRv3):

  * Reply with a Query Message.

#### User requests to end an OTRv4 Conversation

If state is `START`:

  * Do nothing

If state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`:

  * Send a data message with an encoding of the message with an empty
    human-readable part, and the TLV type 1.
  * Transition to the `START` state.

If state is `FINISHED`:

  * Transition to state `START`.

## Socialist Millionaires Protocol (SMP)

The Socialist Millionaires Protocol allows two parties with secret information
(`x` and `y`, respectively) to check whether (`x == y`) without revealing any
additional information about the secrets.

OTRv4 makes a few changes to SMP:

  * OTRv4 uses Ed448 as a cryptographic primitive. This changes the way
  values are serialized and how they are computed. To define the SMP values
  under Ed448, we reuse the previously defined generator `G` for Ed448:

  ```
  G = (x=22458004029592430018760433409989603624678964163256413424612546168695
     0415467406032909029192869357953282578032075146446173674602635247710,
     y=29881921007848149267601793044393067343754404015408024209592824137233
     1506189835876003536878655418784733982303233503462500531545062832660)
  ```

  * OTRv4 creates fingerprints using SHAKE-256. The fingerprint is generated as:

      * `HWC(usage_fingerprint || byte(H) || byte(F), 56)`

  * SMP in OTRv4 uses all of the [TLV Record Types](#tlv-record-types) as OTRv3,
    except for SMP Message 1Q. When SMP Message 1Q is used in OTRv4, SMP Message
    1 is used in OTRv4. When a question is not present, the user specified
    question section has length `0` and value `NULL`. In OTRv3, SMP Message 1 is
    used when the user does not specify an SMP question. If a question is
    supplied, SMP Message 1Q is used.
  * SMP in OTRv4 uses the same SMP State Machine as OTRv3, with the exception
    that `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` only accepts SMP Message 1. Note that this
    state machine has no effect on type 0 or type 1 TLVs, which are always
    allowed.
  * While picking random values in `Z_q` for elliptic curve operations for
    SMP, take into account the
    [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
    section.

### SMP Overview

The computations below use the [SMP Secret Information](#secret-information).

Assuming that Alice begins the exchange:

**Alice:**

* Picks random values, each 57 bytes long, for `a2` and `a3` in `Z_q`.
* Picks random values, each 57 bytes long, for `r2` and `r3` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `c2 = HashToScalar(0x01 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - a2 * c2`.
* Computes `c3 = HashToScalar(0x02 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - a3 * c3`.
* Sends Bob a SMP message 1 with `G2a = G * a2`, `c2`, `d2`, `G3a = G * a3`,
  `c3` and `d3`.

**Bob:**

* Validates that `G2a` and `G3a` are on the curve Ed448, that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Picks random values, each 57 bytes long, for `b2` and `b3` in `Z_q`.
* Picks random values, each 57 bytes long, for `r2`, `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `r6`
  in `Z_q`.
* Computes `G2b = G * b2` and `G3b = G * b3`.
* Computes `c2 = HashToScalar(0x03 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - b2 * c2`.
* Computes `c3 = HashToScalar(0x04 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - b3 * c3`.
* Computes `G2 = G2a * b2` and `G3 = G3a * b3`.
* Computes `Pb = G3 * r4` and `Qb = G * r4 + G2 * (y mod q)`, where
  `y` is the SMP secret value.
* Computes `cp = HashToScalar(5 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
  `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp` and `d6 = (r6 - (y mod q) * cp) mod q`.
* Sends Alice a SMP message 2 with `G2b`, `c2`, `d2`, `G3b`, `c3`, `d3`, `Pb`,
  `Qb`, `cp`, `d5` and `d6`.

**Alice:**

* Validates that `G2b` and `G3b` are on the curve Ed448, that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Computes `G2 = G2b * a2` and `G3 = G3b * a3`.
* Picks random values, each 57 bytes long, for `r4`, `r5`, `r6` and `r7`
  in `Z_q`.
* Computes `Pa = G3 * r4` and `Qa = G * r4 + G2 * (x mod q)`,
  where `x` is the SMP secret value.
* Computes `cp = HashToScalar(0x06 || G3 * r5 || G * r5 + G2 * r6)`,
  `d5 = r5 - r4 * cp` and `(d6 = r6 - (x mod q) * cp) mod q`.
* Computes `Ra = (Qa - Qb) * a3`.
* Computes `cr = HashToScalar(0x07 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and
  `d7 = r7 - a3 * cr`.
* Sends Bob a SMP message 3 with `Pa`, `Qa`, `cp`, `d5`, `d6`, `Ra`, `cr` and
  `d7`.

**Bob:**

* Validates that `Pa`, `Qa`, and `Ra` are on the curve Ed448 that they are in
  the correct group and that they do not degenerate.
* Picks a random value of 57 bytes long for `r7` in `Z_q`.
* Computes `Rb = (Qa - Qb) * b3`.
* Computes `Rab = Ra * b3`.
* Computes `cr = HashToScalar(0x08 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and
  `d7 = r7 - b3 * cr`.
* Checks whether `Rab == Pa - Pb`.
* Sends Alice a SMP message 4 with `Rb`, `cr`, `d7`.

**Alice:**

* Validates that `Rb` is on curve Ed448. See
  [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
  section for details.
* Computes `Rab = Rb * a3`.
* Checks whether `Rab == Pa - Pb`.

If everything is done correctly, then `Rab` should hold the value of
`(Pa - Pb) * ((G2 * a3 * b3) * (x - y))`.  This test will only succeed if the
secret information provided by each participant are equal
(essentially `x == y`). Further, since `G2 * a3 * b3` is a random number not
known to any party, if `x` is not equal to `y`, no other information is
revealed.

### Secret Information

The secret information `x` and `y` compared during this protocol contains not
only information entered by the users, but also information unique to the
conversation in which SMP takes place. This includes the Secure Session ID
(SSID) whose creation is described
[here](#interactive-deniable-authenticated-key-exchange-dake)
and [here](#non-interactive-auth-message).

The format for the secret information is:

```
Version (BYTE)
  The version of SMP used. The version described here is 1.
Initiator fingerprint (56 BYTEs)
  The fingerprint that the party initiating SMP is using in the current
  conversation.
Responder fingerprint (56 BYTEs)
  The fingerprint that the party that did not initiate SMP is using in the
  current conversation.
Secure Session ID or SSID (8 BYTEs)
User-specified secret (DATA)
  The input string given by the user at runtime.
  It is encoded as UTF-8.
```

The first 57 bytes of a SHAKE-256 hash of the above is taken, the digest is then
pruned as defined in the
[Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
section. This digest then becomes the SMP secret value (`x` or `y`) to be used
in SMP. The additional fields ensure that not only do both parties know the same
secret input string, but no man-in-the-middle is capable of reading their
communication either:

```
  x or y = HWC(usage_SMP_secret || version || Initiator fingerprint ||
  Responder fingerprint || Secure Session ID or SSID || User-specified secret),
  57)
```

### SMP Hash Function

There are many places where the 57 bytes of a SHAKE-256 hash are taken of
an integer followed by other values. This is defined as `HashToScalar(i || v)`
where `i` is an integer used to distinguish the calls to the hash function and
`v` are some values. Hashing is done in this way to prevent Alice from replaying
Bob's zero knowledge proofs or vice versa.

### SMP Message 1

Alice sends SMP message 1 to begin an ECDH exchange to determine two new
generators, `g2` and `g3`. A valid SMP message 1 is generated as follows:

1. Determine her secret input `x`, which is to be compared to Bob's secret
   `y`, as specified in the [Secret Information section](#secret-information).
1. Pick random values, each 57 bytes long, for `a2` and `a3` in `Z_q`. These
   will be Alice's exponents for the ECDH exchange to pick generators. These
   random values should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Pick random values of 57-bytes long for `r2` and `r3` in `Z_q`. These will be
   used to generate zero-knowledge proofs that this message was created according
   to the SMP protocol. These random values should be hashed and pruned as
   defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Interpret `a2`, `a3`, `r2` and `r3` as little-endian integers forming
   scalars.
1. Compute `G2a = G * a2` and `G3a = G * a3`. Check that `G2a` and `G3a` are on
   curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `a2` is known by setting
   `c2 = HashToScalar(0x01 || G * r2)` and `d2 = r2 - a2 * c2 mod q`.
1. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `a3` is known by setting
   `c3 = HashToScalar(0x02 || G * r3)` and `d3 = r3 - a3 * c3 mod q`.
1. Store the values of `x`, `a2` and `a3` for use later in the protocol.


The SMP message 1 has the following data and format:

```
Question (DATA)
  A user-specified question, which is associated with the user-specified secret
  information. If there is no question input from the user, the length of this
  is 0 and the data is 'NULL'.

G2a (POINT)
  Alice's half of the ECDH exchange to determine G2.

c2 (SCALAR), d2 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Alice knows the value associated with her
  transmitted value G2a.

G3a (POINT)
  Alice's half of the ECDH exchange to determine G3.

c3 (SCALAR), d3 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Alice knows the value associated with her
  transmitted value G3a.

```

### SMP Message 2

SMP message 2 is sent by Bob to complete the ECDH exchange to determine the new
generators, `g2` and `g3`. It also begins the construction of the values used in
the final comparison of the protocol. A valid SMP message 2 is generated as
follows:

1. Validate that `G2a` and `G3a` are on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Determine Bob's secret input `y`, which is to be compared to Alice's secret
   `x`.
1. Pick random values, each 57 bytes long, for `b2` and `b3` in `Z_q`. These
   will be used for creating the generators `g2` and `g3`. These random values
   should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Pick random values, each 57 bytes long for `r2`, `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `r6`
   in `Z_q`. These will be used to add a blinding factor to the final results,
   and to generate zero-knowledge proofs that state that this message was
   created honestly. These random values should be hashed and pruned as
   defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Interpret `b2`, `b3`, `r2` and `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `r6` as little-endian
   integers forming scalars.
1. Compute `G2b = G * b2` and `G3b = G * b3`. Check that `G2b` and `G3b` are on
   curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that the value `b2` is known by setting

### SMP Message 3

SMP message 3 is Alice's final message in the SMP exchange. It has the last of
the information required by Bob to determine if `x == y`. A valid SMP message 3
is generated as follows:

1. Pick random values, each 57 bytes long, for `r4`, `r5`, `r6` and `r7`
   in `Z_q`. These will be used to add a blinding factor to the final results
   and to generate zero-knowledge proofs that this message was created honestly.

   section for details.
1. Generate a zero-knowledge proof that `Ra` was created according to the
   protocol by setting `cr = HashToScalar(0x07 || G * r7 || (Qa - Qb) * r7)` and

1. Store the values of `G3b`, `Pa - Pb`, `Qa - Qb` and `a3` for use later in
   the protocol.

```

### SMP Message 4

SMP message 4 is Bob's final message in the SMP exchange. It has the last of the
information required by Alice to determine if `x == y`. A valid SMP message 4 is
generated as follows:

1. Validate that `Pa`, `Qa`, and `Ra` are on curve Ed448. See
   [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
   section for details.
1. Pick a random value of 57-bytes long for `r7` in `Z_q`. This will be used to generate
   Bob's final zero-knowledge proof that this message was created honestly.
   This random value should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Interpret `r7` as little-endian integer forming a scalar.

  share the same secret.

cr (SCALAR), d7 (SCALAR)
  A zero-knowledge proof that Rb was created according to this SMP protocol.
```

### The SMP State Machine

OTRv4 does not change the state machine for SMP from OTRv3. But the following
sections detail how values are computed differently during some states. Each
case assumes that the protocol state is `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`. It must be taken
into account that state `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` is reached whenever an error occurs
or SMP is aborted. In that case, the protocol must be restarted from the
beginning. Whenever the OTRv4 message state machine is in `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`
state, the SMP state machine may progress. If at any point you are not in
`ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES`, the SMP must abandon its state and return to its initial
setup.

#### User requests to begin SMP

If smpstate is not set to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

  * SMP is already underway. If you wish to restart the SMP, send a type 6 TLV
    (SMP abort) to the other party and then proceed as if smpstate was
    `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`. Otherwise, you may simply continue the current SMP
    instance.

If smpstate is set to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

  * No current exchange is underway. In this case, Alice creates a valid type 2
    TLV (SMP message 1) as follows:
    1. Create a valid SMP Message 1 as defined in its [section](#smp-message-1).
    1. Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT2`.

#### User requests to abort SMP

In all cases, send a type 6 TLV (SMP abort) to the correspondent and set
smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 1

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`
  * Send a SMP abort to Alice.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`:

* Verify Alice's zero-knowledge proofs for `G2a` and `G3a`:
  1. Check that both `G2a` and `G3a` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  1. Check that `c2 == HashToScalar(0x01 || G * d2 + G2a * c2)`.
  1. Check that `c3 == HashToScalar(0x02 || G * d3 + G3a * c3)`.
* Create a SMP message 2 and send it to Alice.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 2

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT2`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a SMP abort to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT2`:

* Verify Bob's zero-knowledge proofs for `G2b`, `G3b`, `Pb` and `Qb`:
  1. Check that `G2b`, `G3b`, `Pb` and `Qb` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  1. Check that `c2 == HashToScalar(0x03 || G * d2 + G2b * c2)`.
  1. Check that `c3 == HashToScalar(0x04 || G * d3 + G3b * c3)`.
  1. Check that `cp == HashToScalar(0x05 || G3 * d5 + Pb * cp || G * d5 + G2 *
     d6 + Qb * cp)`.
* Create a SMP message 3 and send it to Bob.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 3

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a SMP abort to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT3`:

* Verify Alice's zero-knowledge proofs for `Pa`, `Qa` and `Ra`:
  1. Check that `Pa`, `Qa` and `Ra` are on curve Ed448. See
     [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
     section for details.
  1. Check that `cp == HashToScalar(0x06 || G3 * d5 + Pa * cp || G * d5 + G2 *
     d6 + Qa * cp)`.
  1. Check that `cr == HashToScalar(0x07 || G * d7 + G3a * cr || (Qa - Qb) *
     d7 + Ra * cr)`.
* Create a SMP message 4 and send it to Alice.
* Check whether the protocol was successful:
  1. Compute `Rab = Ra * b3`.
  1. Determine if `x == y` by checking the equivalent condition that
     `Pa - Pb == Rab`.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`, as no more messages are expected from
  Alice.

#### Receiving a SMP Message 4

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If smpstate is not `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`:

  * Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1` and send a type 6 TLV (SMP abort) to Bob.

If smpstate is `SMPSTATE_EXPECT4`:

* Verify Bob's zero-knowledge proof for Rb:
   1. Check that `Rb` is on curve Ed448. See
      [Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
      section for details.
   1. Check that `cr == HashToScalar(0x08 || G * d7 + G3b * cr || (Qa - Qb) *
      d7 + Rb * cr)`.
* Check whether the protocol was successful:
   1. `Compute Rab = Rb * a3`.
   1. Determine if `x == y` by checking the equivalent condition that
      `(Pa - Pb) == Rab`.
* Set smpstate to `SMPSTATE_EXPECT1`, as no more messages are expected
  from Bob.

## Implementation Notes

### Considerations for Networks that allow Multiple Clients

When using a transport network that allows multiple clients to be
simultaneously logged in with the same peer identifier, make sure to identify
the other participant by its client-specific identifier and not only the peer
identifier (for example, using XMPP full JID instead of bare JID). Doing so
allows establishing multiple OTR channels at the same time with multiple clients
from the other participant. This can cost that the client manages this exposure
(for example, XMPP clients can decide to reply only to the client you have more
recently received a message from).

## Forging Transcripts

OTRv4 expects each implementation of this specification to expose an interface
for producing forged transcripts. These forging operations must use the same
functions used for honest conversations. This section will outline the
operations that must be exposed and include guidance to forge messages.

In OTRv4, anyone can forge messages after a conversation to make them look like
they came from them. However, during a conversation, your correspondent is
assured that the messages they see are authentic and unmodified. Easily
forgeable transcripts achieve the offline deniability property: if someone
claims a participant said something over OTR, they'll have no way to proof so,
as anyone could have modify a transcript.

The major utilities for forging are:

```
Parse
  Parses OTRv4 messages to the values of each of the fields in them and shows
  these fields.

Modify Data Message
  If an encrypted data message cannot be read because you don't know the message
  key (or one of the chain keys used to derive this message key) but it can be
  guessed that the string 'x' appears at a given place in the message, a
  participant can replace that string with some new desired text with the same
  length. The result is a valid OTRv4 message that contains the new text. For
  example, if the string "hi" is accurately guessed to be at the beginning of
  an encrypted message, it can be replaced with the string "yo". Therefore, a
  valid data message can be created with new text.

  To achieve this:
  - XOR the old text and the new text. Store this value.
  - XOR the stored value again with the original encrypted message starting
    at a given offset.
  - Recalculate the MAC tag with the revealed MAC key associated with this
    message. The new tag is attached to the data message, replacing the old
    value.
```

[Pseudocode](#modify-an-encrypted-data-message) for modifying data messages is
included in the [Appendices](#appendices).

```
Read and Forge Data Message
  Read and forge allows someone in possession of a chain key to decrypt OTR
  messages or modify them as forgeries. It takes three inputs: the chain key,
  the OTRv4 message and a new plain text message (optional). If a new
  message is included, the original text is replaced with the new message and
  a new MAC tag is attached to the data message.

  To achieve this:
  - Decrypt the data message with the corresponding message key derived from
    the given chain key.
  - If a new message is given, replace the message with that one, encrypt it
    and create its mac accordingly.

Forge DAKE and Session Keys
  Any participant of an OTR conversation may forge a DAKE with another
  participant as long as they have their Client Profile. This function will
  take the Client Profile and the secret long-term key of one participant, and
  the Client Profile of the other (or Prekey Ensemble in case of
  non-interactive DAKE). It will return a DAKE transcript between the two
  parties. The participant's private key is required since it is used to
  authenticate the key exchange, but the resulting transcript is created in
  such a way that a cryptographic expert cannot identify which client profile
  owner authenticated the conversation.

Show MAC Key
  This function takes an message key and shows the corresponding MAC key.
  'Show MAC key' may be used with the ReMAC Message function below in the case
  where a message key has been compromised by an attacker who wishes to forge
  messages.

ReMAC Message
  This will make a new OTR Data Message with a given MAC key and an original
  OTR data message. The user's message in the OTR data message is already
  encrypted. A new MAC tag will be generated and replaced for the message. An
  attacker may use this function to forge messages with a compromised MAC key.

Impersonate Initiator or Responder
  In the case of wanting to impersonate the responder, this function takes the
  long-term secret key of the Identifier as input. It will make the owner of
  this long-term secret key to pretend to be the Responder by executing the RSig
  functionality with those keys. This can happen in the interactive and
  non-interactive DAKE.
  In the case of wanting to impersonate the identifier, this function takes the
  long-term secret key of the Responder as input. It will make the owner of
  this long-term secret key to pretend to be the Identifier by executing the
  RSig functionality with those keys. This can only happen in the interactive
  DAKE.

False Prekey Ensemble
  This function will return a false Prekey Ensemble for the Identifier. It
  will only be used for the non-interactive DAKE.

Forge Entire Transcript
  The Forge Entire Transcript function will allow one participant to completely
  forge a transcript between them and another person in a way that its forgery
  cannot be cryptographically proven. The input will be: one participant's Client
  Profile, their secret key, another participant's Client Profile, and a list of
  plain text messages corresponding to what messages were exchanged. Each
  message in the list will have the structure: 1) sender 2) plain text message,
  so that the function may precisely create the desired transcript. The
  participant's private key is required since it is used to authenticate the key
  exchange, but the resulting transcript is created in such a way that a
  cryptographic expert cannot identify which Client Profile owner authenticated
  the conversation.

### Ring Signature Authentication

The Authentication scheme consists of two functions:

- An authentication function: `sigma = RSig(A1, a1, {A1, A2, A3}, m)`.
- A verification function: `RVrf({A1, A2, A3}, sigma, m)`.

#### Domain Parameters

We reuse the previously defined G generator in elliptic curve parameters:

```
G = (x=22458004029592430018760433409989603624678964163256413424612546168695

```

#### Authentication: RSig(A1, a1, {A1, A2, A3}, m):

`RSig` produces a SoK (signature of knowledge), named `sigma`, bound to the
message `m`, that demonstrates knowledge of a private key corresponding to one
of three public keys.

In the case the DAKEs used for interactive and non-interactive, `A1` is the
public value associated with `a1`, that is, `A1 = G * a1` and `m` is the message
to authenticate.

To compute `RSig`, without loss of generality:

`A1`, `A2`, and `A3` should be checked to verify that they are on the curve
Ed448. See
[Verifying that a point is on the curve](#verifying-that-a-point-is-on-the-curve)
section for details.

1. Pick random values `t1, c2, c3, r2, r3` in `Z_q`.
   These random values should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Compute `T1 = G * t1`.
1. Compute `T2 = G * r2 + A2 * c2`.
1. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`.
1. Compute `c = HashToScalar(usage_auth || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 ||
   T2 || T3 || m)`.
1. Compute `c1 = c - c2 - c3 (mod q)`.
1. Compute `r1 = t1 - c1 * a1 (mod q)`. Securely delete `t1`.
1. Send `sigma = (c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.

This function can be generalized so it is not possible to determine which secret
key was used to produce this ring signature, even if all secret keys are
revealed. For this, constant-time conditional operations should be used.

The prover knows a secret `ai` and, therefore:

1. Pick random values `t1, t2, t3, c1, c2, c3, r1, r2, r3` in `Z_q`.
   These random values should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Compute:

```
  P = G * ai
  eq1 = constant_time_eq(P, A1)
  eq2 = constant_time_eq(P, A2)
  eq3 = constant_time_eq(P, A3)
```

1. Depending of the result of the above operations, compute:

```
  T1 = constant_time_select(eq1, encode(G * t1), encode(G * r1 + A1 * c1))
  T2 = constant_time_select(eq2, encode(G * t2), encode(G * r2 + A2 * c2))
  T3 = constant_time_select(eq3, encode(G * t3), encode(G * r3 + A3 * c3))
```

1. Compute `c = HashToScalar(usage_auth || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 ||
   T2 || T3 || m)`.
1. For whichever equally returns true (if `eqi == 1`, `eqj == 0` and
   `eqk == 0`, for `i != j != k`): `ci = c - cj - ck (mod q)`.
1. For whichever equally returns true (for example, if `eqi == 1`):
   `ri = ti - ci * ai (mod q)`. Securely delete `ti`.
1. Compute `sigma = (ci, ri, cj, rj, ck, rk)`.

If the prover knows `a2`, for example, the `RSig` function looks like this:
`RSig(A2, a2, {A1, A2, A3}, m)`

1. Pick random values `t2, c1, c3, r1, r3` in `Z_q`.
   These random values should be hashed and pruned as defined in the
   [Considerations while working with elliptic curve parameters](#considerations-while-working-with-elliptic-curve-parameters)
   section prior to be used.
1. Compute `T2 = G * t2`.
1. Compute `T1 = G * r1 + A1 * c1`.
1. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`.
1. Compute
   `c = HashToScalar(usage_auth || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 || T3 ||
   m)`.
1. Compute `c2 = c - c1 - c3 (mod q)`.
1. Compute `r2 = t2 - c2 * a2 (mod q)`.
1. Send `sigma = (c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.

The order of elements passed to `H` and sent to the verifier must not depend
on the secret known by the prover (otherwise, the key used to produce the proof
can be inferred in practice).

#### Verification: RVrf({A1, A2, A3}, sigma, m)

`RVrf` is the verification function for the SoK `sigma`, created by `RSig`.

`A1`, `A2`, and `A3` should be checked to verify that they are on curve Ed448.

1. Parse `sigma` to retrieve components `(c1, r1, c2, r2, c3, r3)`.
1. Compute `T1 = G * r1 + A1 * c1`
1. Compute `T2 = G * r2 + A2 * c2`
1. Compute `T3 = G * r3 + A3 * c3`
1. Compute
   `h = HWC(usage_auth || G || q || A1 || A2 || A3 || T1 || T2 || T3 ||
   m)`.
1. Compute `c = h (mod q)`.
1. Check if `c ≟ c1 + c2 + c3 (mod q)`. If it is true, verification succeeds.
   If not, it fails.

### HashToScalar

This function is `HashToScalar(usageID || d, 57)`, where d is an array of
bytes.

1. Compute `h = HWC(usageID || d, 57)`.
1. Interpret the buffer as a little-endian integer, forming a scalar. Return
   this scalar.

### Modify an Encrypted Data Message

In this example, a forger guesses that "hi" is at the beginning of an encrypted
message. Thus, its offset is 0. The forger wants to replace "hi" with "yo".

```
  offset = 0
  old_text = "hi"
  new_text = "yo"
  text_length = string_length_of(old_text)
  old_encrypted_message = get_from_data_message()
  encrypted_message_length = string_length_of(old_encrypted_message)

  for (i=0; i < text_length && offset+i < encrypted_message_length; i++) {
      old_encrypted_message[offset+i] ^= old_text[i] ^ new_text[i]
  }

  new_encrypted_message = old_encrypted_message

  new_mac_tag = mac(new_encrypted_message, revealed_mac_key)

  new_data_message = replace(old_data_message, new_encrypted_message, new_mac_tag)

```

### OTRv3 Specific Encoded Messages

#### D-H Commit Message

This is the first message of OTRv3 AKE. Bob sends it to Alice to commit to a
choice of D-H encryption key (but the key itself is not yet revealed). This
allows the secure session id to be much shorter than in OTRv1, while still
preventing a man-in-the-middle attack on it.

The D-H Commit Message consists of the protocol version, the message type, the
sender's instance tag, the receiver's instance tag, the encoded encrypted
sender's public key and the hashed sender's public key.

#### D-H Key Message

This is the second message of OTRv3 AKE. Alice sends it to Bob.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag and the public key.

#### Reveal Signature Message

This is the third message of the OTRv3 AKE. Bob sends it to Alice, revealing his
D-H encryption key (and thus opening an encrypted channel), and also
authenticating himself (and the parameters of the channel, preventing a
man-in-the-middle attack on the channel itself) to Alice.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag, the revealed key, the encrypted signature and
the MAC of the signature.

#### Signature Message

This is the final message of the OTRv3 AKE. Alice sends it to Bob,
authenticating herself and the channel parameters to him.

It consists of: the protocol version, the message type, the sender's instance
tag, the receiver's instance tag, the encrypted signature and the MAC of the
signature.

#### Data Message

In OTRv3, this message is used to transmit a private message to the
correspondent. It is also used to reveal old MAC keys.

#### Receiving a D-H Commit Message

If the message is version 3 and version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore the message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`:

  * Reply with a `D-H Key Message`, and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`:

  * This indicates that you have already sent a `D-H Commit message` to your
    peer, but that it either didn't receive it, or just didn't receive it yet
    and has sent you one as well. The symmetry will be broken by comparing the
    hashed `g^x` you sent in your `D-H Commit Message` with the one you
    received, considered as 32-byte unsigned big-endian values.

  * If yours is the higher hash value:

    * Ignore the incoming `D-H Commit message`, but resend your
      `D-H Commit message`.

  * Otherwise:

    * Forget the old encrypted `g^x` value that you sent earlier, and pretend
      you're in `AUTHSTATE_NONE`. For example, reply with a `D-H Key Message`,
      and transition `authstate` to `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Retransmit your `D-H Key Message` (the same one you sent when you entered
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`). Forget the old `D-H Commit message` and
    use this new one instead.

    There are a number of reasons this might happen, including:

    * Your correspondent simply started a new AKE.
    * Your correspondent resent his `D-H Commit message`, as specified above.
    * On some networks, like AIM, if your correspondent is logged in multiple
      times, each of his clients will send a `D-H Commit Message` in response
      to a Query Message. Resending the same `D-H Key Message` in response to
      each of those messages will prevent confusion, since each of the clients
      will see each of the `D-H Key Messages` sent.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Reply with a new `D-H Key message` and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`.

#### Receiving a D-H Key Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using:

  * Ignore the message.

If the message is version 3 and version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`:

  * Reply with a `Reveal Signature Message` and transition authstate to
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * If this `D-H Key message` is the same you received earlier (when you entered
    `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`):
    * Retransmit your `Reveal Signature Message`.

  * Otherwise:
    * Ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`, or
`AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP`:

  * Ignore the message.

#### Receiving a Reveal Signature Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using, ignore the message.

If version 3 is not allowed:

   * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Use the received value of `r` to decrypt the value of `g^x` received in the
    D-H Commit Message, and verify the hash therein.
  * Decrypt the encrypted signature, and verify the signature and the MACs. If
    everything checks out:

    * Reply with a Signature Message.
    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_NONE`.
    * Transition msgstate to `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`.
    * If there is a recent stored message, encrypt it and send it as a Data
      Message.

  * Otherwise:

    * Ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY` or
`AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Ignore the message.

#### Receiving a Signature Message

If the instance tag in the message is not the instance tag you are currently
using:

  * Ignore the message.

If version 3 is not allowed:

  * Ignore this message.

Otherwise:

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG`:

  * Decrypt the encrypted signature, and verify the signature and the MACs. If
    everything checks out:

    * Transition authstate to `AUTHSTATE_NONE`.
    * Transition msgstate to `MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED`.
    * If there is a recent stored message, encrypt it and send it as a Data
      Message.

  * Otherwise, ignore the message.

If authstate is `AUTHSTATE_NONE`, `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY`
or `AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG`:

  * Ignore the message.

### OTRv3 Protocol State Machine

OTRv3 defines three main state variables:

#### Message State

The message state variable `msgstate` controls what happens to outgoing messages
typed by the user. It can take one of three values:

```
MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent without encryption. This
  is the state used before an OTRv3 conversation is initiated. This is the
  initial state, and the only way to subsequently enter this state is for the
  user to explicitly request so via some UI operation.

MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent encrypted. This is the
  state that is used during an OTRv3 conversation. The only way to enter this
  state is when the authentication state machine (below) is completed.

MSGSTATE_FINISHED
  This state indicates that outgoing messages are not delivered at all. This
  state is entered only when the other party indicates that its side of the
  conversation has ended. For example, if Alice and Bob are having an OTR
  conversation, and Bob instructs his OTR client to end its private session with
  Alice (for example, by logging out), Alice will be notified of this, and her
  client will switch to 'MSGSTATE_FINISHED' mode. This prevents Alice from
  accidentally sending a message to Bob in plaintext (consider what happens if
  Alice was in the middle of typing a private message to Bob when he suddenly
  logs out, just as Alice hits Enter.)
```

#### Authentication State

The authentication state variable `authstate` can take one of four values:

```
AUTHSTATE_NONE
  This state indicates that the authentication protocol is not currently in
  progress. This is the initial state.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY
  After Bob initiates the authentication protocol by sending Alice the 'D-H
  Commit Message', he enters this state to await Alice's reply.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG
  After Alice receives Bob's D-H Commit Message, and replies with her own 'D-H
  Key Message', she enters this state to await Bob's reply.

AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG
  After Bob receives Alice's 'D-H Key Message', and replies with his own Reveal
  Signature Message, he enters this state to await Alice's reply.

```

### Elliptic Curve Operations

#### Point Addition

For point addition, the following method is recommended, as defined in RFC 8032.
A point `(x,y)` is represented in projective coordinates `(X, Y, Z)`, with
`x = X/Z`, `y = Y/Z` with `Z != 0`.

The neutral point is `(0,1)`, or equivalently in projective coordinates
`(0, Z, Z)` for any non-zero `Z`.

The following formula is for adding two points, `(x3,y3) = (x1,y1) + (x2,y2)`
(or `X_1 : Y_1 : Z_1) + X_2 : Y_2 : Z_2 = X_3 : Y_3 : Z_3`) on untwisted Edwards
curve (i.e., `a = 1`) with non-square `d`, as defined in [\[10\]](#references).
They are complete (they work for any pair of valid input points):

Compute:

```
                 A = Z1 * Z2
                 B = A^2
                 C = X1 * X2
                 D = Y1 * Y2
                 E = d * C * D
                 F = B - E
                 G = B + E
                 H = (X1 + Y1) * (X2 + Y2)
                 X3 = A * F * (H - C - D)
                 Y3 = A * G * (D - C)
                 Z3 = F * G
```
